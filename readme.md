# Persona 2 Eternal Punishment translation template

## Requirements
[p2_modtool](https://github.com/eiowlta/p2_tool) installed
an unmodified copy of Persona 2 Eternal Punishment for the PSP.  For convenience, naming it batsu.iso and dropping it in this folder will let you run build.bat/build.sh without trouble.  Otherwise you need to edit these files to point to your unmodified iso or use the command line directly
