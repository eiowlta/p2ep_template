msg_6:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]I don’t get good vibes... from this place.
[tab]Having a place like this near a school,
[tab]is a bad environment for the students.

[tab]like this. This is a place for kids.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_17:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Age doesn’t differentiate kids and adults.
[tab]It’s how they live. That’s the question.
[tab]...But they’re still too childish..
[wait][clear][end]

msg_18:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]The most reckless ones get misunderstood.
[tab]Misfits just want to express themselves.
[tab]...There are adults like that, too, right?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_19:
[color(yellow)]Nanjo[color(white)]
[tab]To make their own world in a place like
[tab]this to enjoy, is indeed a childish act.

msg_20:
