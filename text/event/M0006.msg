[tab]The outcomes in Wang Long are so simple.
[tab]It’s either really good or really bad.
[tab]You either win or lose.

msg_7:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]Most fortune telling is pretty vague
[tab]but Wang Long is really specific. 
[tab]And plus, it’s accurate, so it’s very popular.

msg_13:

[tab]Did he commit the serial murders...
[tab]no, it’s too early to decide that.

msg_15:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]The serial killings started about six

[tab]Why does he know about my father...?
[tab]And that voice... I’ve heard it before.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_21:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]I think I’ll believe that Sneak. But it’s
[tab]a fact that the information is leaking...
[tab]We had better not be tricked...

msg_22:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]If Tatsuya Sudou isn’t the Joker,
[tab]then he didn’t do the killings 10
[tab]years ago. I’m fairly sure of that.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_23:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]The "Kotodama" that Sudou was talking
[tab]about must mean "rumors". So that means he
[tab]became the Joker by the power of rumors.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_24:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]That wussie’s brother...[tatsuya] was it...

[tab]Who is he? What does he have to do with
[tab]the "Other Side" that Sudou mentioned?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_26:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]He said that the hunting was part of their scheme. 
[tab]The abductions that are happening must be 
[tab]related too. They’re hard to get.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_27:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Damn... my chin’s still shaking.
[tab]Women don’t know leniency...
