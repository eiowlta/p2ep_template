The charred dance floor was choked with smoke.
[tatsuya]-kun stood in its center with slumped 
shoulders and let the water gushing from the 
sprinklers strike him.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_1:
Sudou’s sword, thrust into the floor in front of me, 
brought to mind a grave marker. 
In the rain, he was a solitary silhouette reminiscing 
on a lover lost a long, long time ago. 
[wait][clear]Lone Shadow... 
He struck a desolate figure, 
like something torn from a movie by that kind of title.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_2:
Maybe the fury I’d caught a glimpse of a 
moment ago had been a dream. 
The flames had already been extinguished, 
but no fire alarm had gone off. 
[wait][clear]Had one not been installed, or was it turned off? 
Either way, that was a violation of 
the Fire Services Act.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_3:
Sudou had escaped. Just before [tatsuya]-kun’s 
wooden sword could split his face in two, 
he’d vanished, as if sucked in, into a round 
patch of darkness that had opened up in midair.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_4:
For a long time after that, [tatsuya]-kun stood
stock still. I just watched him. 
We were both soaked from head to toe.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_5:
At last, head still bowed, he pulled out the 
sword Sudou left behind and murmured, subdued:
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_6:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]What was your brother’s name...?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_7:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]Takuya. 
[tab]If he had lived, he would be about your age.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_8:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Can I ask when he died...?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_9:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]It was a sweltering summer night. 
[tab]Ten years ago, August the XXth. 
[tab]On the grounds of the shrine in Rengedai.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_10:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]I found him. 
[tab]Sudou had just thrown Takuya’s head into 
[tab]the underbrush and was about to run away.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_11:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]That’s the day... 
[tab]How could this be...?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_12:
[tatsuya]-kun faced me with a look like he wished he 
could be anywhere but here. The golden retriever that 
Takuya and I kept when we were kids often had that 
look when our mom got mad at him.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_13:
But this kid could never be someone’s pet dog. 
He was more like... a wounded lion who had removed 
himself from the pride.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_14:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]The only people who ever believed me 
[tab]when I said I saw Sudou’s face were 
[tab]your father and one other police officer. 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]Your father promised me he’d arrest Sudou.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_15:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]Three days after that, 
[tab]your father was discharged for accepting bribes.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_16:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]Purportedly, he’d accepted multiple bribes in 
[tab]compensation for disclosing investigation info to  
[tab]organized crime groups. It was complete bullshit.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_17:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]Your father had been set up by Sudou’s father 
[tab]and another police officer. His partner betrayed him.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_18:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]. . . . . . . . . 
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_19:
Dammit, there was no stopping it now. 
This wasn’t my story to share, 
but it wasn’t fair to get him to tell me 
everything he knew if I didn’t spill my guts too.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_20:
Whatever burden this kid was carrying, 
I wanted to share it. I couldn’t help but feel that if 
I didn’t, he’d end up falling into a bottomless Hell.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_21:
I was sure he was just barely keeping his balance on a 
very thin edge, much like the blade he now had
in hand. There was no way it was okay for a teenage 
boy to make a face like that.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_22:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]But you know, it was only just recently 
[tab]that I learned that myself. 
[tab]I always held a grudge against your dad. 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]That’s why I became a cop. 
[tab]I thought the police weren’t trustworthy.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_23:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]I’m sorry... 
[tab]Your father was a fine police officer.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_24:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]He took responsibility for a crime he didn’t 
[tab]commit to protect you, your brother, me, 
[tab]and his back-stabbing friend from Sudou. 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]It must have killed him inside...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_25:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Oh...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_26:
I might have just made things worse. 
I didn’t have the silver key to 
open the door he had shut tight.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_27:
I wagered the only one who did was Maya Amano. 
But whether with a wire or whatever, 
I wanted to meddle anyway and pick that lock open.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_28:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]I’m so sorry... 
[tab]What Sudou said was true. 
[tab]It’s my fault your little brother died...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_29:
At that point, I still had no concept whatsoever 
of the conscious size or palpable weight of the 
sins he’d shouldered.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_30:
To[tab]Be[tab]Continued...
[sync][wait][clear][end]
