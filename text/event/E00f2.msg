[color(yellow)]Middle-Aged Security Guard[color(white)]
[tab]That’s definitely [tatsuya]’s voice... 
[tab]Unbelievable. 
[tab]How can this be...?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_6:
Former Detective [suou] removed the earphone, 
shook his head and looked up at me.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_7:
After a moment, he half-rose from the bench and 
handed the voice recorder back to me. 
There was no change in his dumbfounded expression. 
Of course.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_8:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]If I hadn’t seen [tatsuya]-kun and Sudou’s 
[tab]Personas myself, I doubt I’d have believed it either.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_9:
The voice recorder played back what [tatsuya]-kun 
told me about the events on the Other Side and 
his guesses about what’s going to happen here 
on This Side.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_10:
He finally told me after I promised to keep it a secret, 
but I secretly recorded it. Sorry, [tatsuya]-kun. 
Adults will lie without batting an eye.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_11:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya]’s father[color(white)]
[tab]Persona... 
[tab]But is it really possible for rumors to come true...?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_12:
I removed the charm that I’d inserted 
into my police notebook.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_13:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]This is the student emblem that 
[tab][tatsuya]-kun lent me. 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]Supposedly, so long as you have the 
[tab]Seven Sisters emblem on you, 
[tab]you’ll be safe even if Joker targets you.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_14:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]It’s been a hot topic among the kids lately. 
[tab]And in truth, Sudou hasn’t appeared before 
[tab]me ever since.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_15:
So I said, but he probably couldn’t believe me. 
Adults needed adult logic.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_16:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]If you’d like to verify it for yourself, 
[tab]try going to a bar called Parabellum, 
[tab]it’s near this park. 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]Just as the rumors say, 
[tab]they have things like this for sale.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_17:
I opened the front of my jacket and drew the G33 
from the shoulder holster hanging under my left side, 
then removed the magazine to be on the safe side and 
handed him the gun in pieces.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_18:
It might be an ultra-compact handgun that 
you could tuck into the palm of your hand, 
but it used .357 SIG bullets. 

[wait][clear]It had firepower comparable to 
a .357 Magnum-close to five times that 
of the .32s the station lent us. 
It’s often called a "pocket rocket".
[wait][clear][end]

msg_19:
Naturally, these don’t get supplied to 
Japanese police officers. 
[wait][clear]The guns we’re lent for work have to be 
returned each day to the service office, 
so I purchased this weapon for my own 
personal protection.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_20:
If you abide by the rules against criminals 
who use Personas or demons or whatever, 
you won’t be able to defend yourself.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_21:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya]’s father[color(white)]
[tab]This is the real thing...?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_22:
So the former detective growled as he verified 
the weight of the gun and the bullets in the magazine. 
[wait][clear]Said rounds aren’t the so-called full metal jackets, 
which are the full penetration ammo allowed for use 
in P230 JPs and New Nambus.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_23:
These were jacketed hollowpoints, which exposed 
the lead on the tip and had a pit in the center. 
They were warheads meant to stop a person 
stone dead.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_24:
Their penetrative power fell short compared to FMJs,
but when it came to dealing damage to soft targets
like human bodies, they were far superior. 

[wait][clear]This is because the lead mushroomed at the 
moment of impact, it efficiently delivered a 
shock and caused massive blood loss.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_25:
As a result, their use was prohibited in international 
warfare per the Hague Convention. 
I heard it’s because they were deemed inhumane 
due to the unnecessary suffering they caused. 
[wait][clear]Apparently there was such a thing 
in this world as humane warfare.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_26:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]Black Stars and Makarovs aren’t something 
[tab]you can get your hands on at a moment’s notice, 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]even using black market routes from the mainland, 
[tab]the Philippines and Russia.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_27:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab] I don’t know how it works precisely, 
[tab]but I can only conclude that rumors 
[tab]have become true.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_28:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya]’s father[color(white)]
[tab]Put that away right now.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_29:
[suou]-san handed back the gun and magazine, 
then rested his chin on his hands, 
which were propped on top of his thighs, 
and uttered another groan. 
[wait][clear]Next to him, the wrappers for the anpan we’d lined up 
and eaten together earlier swayed in the autumn 
breeze from under the cardboard milk pack.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_30:
He’d squeezed in time for me during his lunch break, 
so we wound up eating here as we talked. 
[wait][clear]It’s barely any meal at all for a security guard 
who spent all his time on his feet, 
but we couldn’t exactly chat about all this over 
at the cafe around the corner.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_31:
I asked when his lunch break ended, 
and that time’s already passed. 
I’d feel bad to keep him here for much longer. 
I’d better get back to the main issue.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_32:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]Even now, [tatsuya]-kun is pursuing Sudou. 
[tab]He believes he’s the only one who can cope 
[tab]with the situation. Or rather...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_33:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]He believes that as the only one who hasn’t lost 
[tab]his memory, he has to do this all alone. 
[tab]That’s why.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_34:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya]’s father[color(white)]
[tab]Is Katsuya aware of the situation?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_35:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]No... I suspect not. It seems Sergeant [suou]
[tab]is cooperating with a woman named Maya Amano,
[tab]whom [tatsuya]-kun is trying to protect.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_36:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab][tatsuya]-kun said he doesn’t want to get his 
[tab]friends from the Other Side or his family involved. 
[tab]That’s why he left home. 
[wait][clear][end]

msg_37:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]This is fundamentally not a task for children. 
[tab]It’s our job as police officers. However, you and I
[tab]both know that the police are not reliable.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_38:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya]’s father[color(white)]
[tab]Togashi’s still...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_39:
Thinking over his former friend, [suou]-san looked 
up at me as if begging for good news. 
I didn’t have any I could tell him, though.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_40:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]He’s connected to Tatsuzou Sudou. 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]It’s clear that he and Captain Shimazu are 
[tab]obstructing the investigation to make sure 
[tab]Tatsuya Sudou doesn’t get detained.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_41:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya]’s father[color(white)]
[tab]Togashi...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_42:
He seemed to age ten years as his head 
sagged down, hand on his brow. 
[wait][clear]It was probably tough knowing his best friend 
betrayed him AND continued to participate in the 
crimes for which "he" should have been arrested.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_43:
Somewhere inside, he had still trusted Togashi.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_44:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]...Right now, the only one who can defeat Sudou 
[tab]and protect the world is [tatsuya]-kun. 
[tab]I realize I’m asking too much.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_45:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]But he can’t shoulder the burden all alone. 
[tab]I’ll support him to the extent that I’m capable.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)] 
[tab][tatsuya]-kun needs the help of adults who know 
[tab]what’s really happening.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_46:
We first met at Zodiac during its remodeling. 
After hearing about the inevitability of 
Takuya’s death and the secrets of the world, 
I forced [tatsuya]-kun to make a deal with me. 
[wait][clear][end]

msg_47:
I’d provide him with a place to stay and 
information on the Sudou investigation. 
In return, he’d make sure Sudou dies and stays dead.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_48:
Most likely, no matter how things go, 
[tatsuya]-kun will eventually have to settle 
things with Sudou regardless.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_49:
Legally speaking, there might be room to assert 
that it was legitimate self-defense. 
However, that doesn’t change the fact that 
he’s hurting and killing someone. 
[wait][clear]No matter how evil that someone may be, 
the fact that he’s ending their life will 
leave an indelible scar on [tatsuya]-kun’s heart.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_50:
But it’s not all his fault. 
I’m the one who requested Sudou’s death. 
I don’t care if it’s just a consolation. 
It might be enough to allow him to forgive himself.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_51:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]Could you... 
[tab]possibly let [tatsuya]-kun do as he wills?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_52:
[suou]-san stood up then, the shade of anguish 
fading from his eyes. It seemed he’d made 
the decision to watch over his son, 
who was trying to oppose a cruel fate.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_53:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya]’s father[color(white)]
[tab] ...Understood. I feel at ease knowing that 
[tab]he’s in your care. I’ll talk to my wife 
[tab]and withdraw the missing persons report.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_54:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]Thank you very much.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_55:
I bowed my head, grateful from the bottom of my heart. 
He was basically telling me he was giving me his son’s life, 
when I couldn’t have complained 
if he’d struck me instead.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_56:
But with this, it should get a little easier 
for [tatsuya]-kun to make his move. 
Even at the best of times, he stands out. 
[wait][clear]So long as he’s moving around in this city, 
it’s better to remove as many unnecessary 
hurdles as possible.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_57:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya]’s father[color(white)]
[tab]I never dreamed that I’d get 
[tab]mixed up in something like this... 
[tab]Is this what you’d call fate?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_58:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya]’s father[color(white)]
[tab]I’d meant to do this for their sake, 
[tab]but ultimately I ended up pushing 
[tab]my failure onto my sons...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_59:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya]’s father[color(white)]
[tab]I’m truly sorry to you too, Shiori-san. 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)][tatsuya]’s father[color(white)]
[tab]I capitulated to Tatsuzou’s 
[tab]threats to protect my family. 
[tab]Thanks to that, you’re now in this position...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_60:
[suou]-san and me, Chief Togashi and Sudou’s son, 
the head of investigations and the kids who 
created This Side, and finally the woman who holds 
the fate of the world: Maya Amano...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_61:
[tatsuya]’s core connections spread out from him 
like a mandala ー but a warped one, 
fashioned by a malicious artisan to mock its 
subject and viewers.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_62:
While the individuals look unrelated at a glance, 
they draw a similar relationship chart 
through someone else. 
[wait][clear]For us, whose names joined the list without 
any of us the wiser, 
ten years’ time hasn’t given us any resolution at all.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_63:
All the loss and despair we struggled to endure, 
all the sorrow and rage that piled upon us, 
was nothing more than the overture. 
[wait][clear]That said, we’ve had plenty of time to make sure 
we recover even so. 
Don’t underestimate us humans.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_64:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]I’m sure I’d have done the same had I been 
[tab]in your shoes. Besides which, 
[tab]I’m glad now that I became a policewoman.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_65:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]I got to meet [tatsuya]-kun, and I can extend a hand
[tab]to kids who’ve committed crimes without forcing 
[tab]them into the twisted society adults created.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_66:
It might be impossible for now, but one day, 
I want to make our society one where kids like 
[tatsuya]-kun can live with a smile. 
That’s the task of us adults.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_67:
Kids mustn’t be forced into a world where they 
have to sacrifice something in order to enter it.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_68:
[color(yellow)]Girl’s voice[color(white)]
[tab]I heard the Aerospace Museum blimp is flying! 
[tab]Let’s go check it out!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_69:
[color(yellow)]Boy’s voice[color(white)]
[tab]Whoa, the rumor it flies was true! 
[tab]Let’s go, let’s go!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_70:
Overhearing the voices of children running nearby, 
[suou]-san and I shared a glance and looked up at the sky. 
I couldn’t see it from here, but perhaps it was true that 
the blimp was flying.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_71:
Come to think of it, I heard fire truck sirens wailing 
just a bit ago. I don’t know why, 
but I got the feeling that [tatsuya]-kun’s 
almost certainly on that blimp.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_72:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]See it through to the end, [tatsuya]-kun... 
[tab]So you don’t regret a thing.
[sync][wait][clear][end]
