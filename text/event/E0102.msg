[tab]I-I heard it was here.

msg_1:
When I made him guide me to where Shiori-san was, 
the man stopped in front of a room that looked like 
a research lab. While I was at it, 
I might as well find out who they are.

Without a word, I pulled back the gun’s hammer.

[tab]E-even if I told you about the New World Order, 
[tab]a kid like you wouldn’t understand a thing about it! 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]X-0 Pilot[color(white)]
[tab]Only the technicians know the details   
[tab]of what’s going on inside.

[tab]Shinjo is conducting a bunch of 
[tab]different experiments using the

[tab]Tatsuzou Sudou-
[tab]I’m sure you’ve at least heard the name. A kid like

Tatsuzou Sudou... Tatsuya Sudou’s father 
and the man who screwed my dad over.
If my memory served me right, even now he 
would still be the foreign minister.

msg_10:
I got it. He would be able to use the cops, the mafia, 
the mass media and facilities like this as he pleased.

By all appearances, it was a safe bet that 
Tatsuzou was "his" favorite errand boy.

I silenced the loose-lipped pilot with a strike to the 
back of the neck with my gun, then passed through 
the door to the research lab.
