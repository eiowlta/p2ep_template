[tab]So this is Kasugayama High School...
[tab]It’s pretty dull... No wonder it
[tab]has such a bad reputation.

msg_2:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]Those kids really are from Kasu High.
[tab]Compare that to Nanjo-kun and Elly-chan...

[tab]Actually, I wanted wine and cigarettes!!

msg_7:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]

msg_16:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]They’re still maturing. We don’t know

[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]Mishina-kun’s apparel was incredible,

[tab]dressing like that?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_19:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]...One day, [tatsuya] stopped coming home.
[tab]Thinking about it now, he may have been

[wait][clear][end]

msg_20:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]They say that Kasugayama students are

msg_32:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Individuality... Originality... By wearing
[tab]a uniform, there’s no such thing, y’know?
[tab]Back then, punkers were original, though.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_33:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Eikichi, huh... Hehe.
[tab]He’d stick out anywhere...
[tab]But "sticking out" sounds kind of pitiful.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_34:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Let’s just call it..."originality".

[tab]If there are teenagers risking their lives fighting, 
[tab]there’re people like that wasting stupid time... 
[tab]Either way is miserable.

[tab]You wish he’d be more dependent, huh? Ha.

[tab]Many students are bound by uniforms.
[tab]I understand it has educational purposes,
[tab]but it also prevents individuality...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_43:
[color(yellow)]Nanjo[color(white)]
[tab]A student’s duty is to study. 
[tab]But just remembering words is not studying.

[wait][clear][end]

msg_44:
[color(yellow)]Nanjo[color(white)]

msg_63:
