[tab]Our hearts are created by multiple layers...
[tab]Normally, our ego is viewed as the "self",
[tab]with our unconsciousness lying beneath.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]Below this, each society has one culture,
[tab]family, etc... the "Collective Unconsciousness".
[tab]These abysses spread out infinitely...
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]Think of the normal unconscious as a sea of
[tab]unconsciousness all humans share... The tiny
[tab]island floating in that sea..that’s "ego".
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]If it is the people’s rumors that created
[tab]this ship, then you can call this Sumaru
[tab]society’s "unconsciousness"...
