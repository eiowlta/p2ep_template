msg_3:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]That "d五j二 vu" stuff again...
[tab]Anyway, let’s apprehend that con-artist.
[tab]We can’t let Serizawa-kun commit a crime.

msg_4:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]I don’t understand, but you can tell by
[tab]looking at his face, right?
[tab]What do you wanna do, just look around?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_5:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Wait... Let’s drop by Hirasaka first. Rumor
[tab]says the head of an Izakaya bar has services
[tab]for locating people... There may be clues.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_6:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]

msg_8:
[color(yellow)]Hard-Working Policeman[color(white)]
[tab]I see. You’re friends of Katsuya-san... 
[tab]He is the hardest working man with a true heart
[tab]for Justice. He is a worrywart though...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_9:
[color(yellow)]Hard-Working Policeman[color(white)]
[tab]What happened at the museum?
[tab]Katsuya-san came back soaking wet...
[tab]Why are we just waiting?

msg_10:
[color(yellow)]Hard-Working Policeman[color(white)]
[tab]The phones are ringing off the hook!
[tab]All of them talk about people going nuts!
[tab]We just can’t keep up with them!

msg_11:
[color(yellow)]Hard-Working Policeman[color(white)]
[tab]Lately, there have been many incidents of
[tab]violence, but we have only one suspect.
[tab]I find that... kind of strange...
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Hard-Working Policeman[color(white)]
[tab]When we arrived at the scene, the commotion
[tab]was over and the suspect was gone. Witnesses
[tab]say the victim was taken away by "someone".
[wait][clear][end]

msg_12:
[color(yellow)]Pale Policeman[color(white)]
[tab]Lately there’s been a lot of creepy cases.
[tab]Especially the murder cases, where they’ve
[tab]been killed gruesomely... Oh, sorry.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_13:
[color(yellow)]Pale Policeman[color(white)]
[tab]Can that really be the work of a human...?
[tab]Before, we could tell if it was a human
[tab]even if a crime was committed...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_14:
[color(yellow)]Pale Policeman[color(white)]
[tab]Every time Katsuya-san comes back, 
[tab]he runs straight for the Chief’s room.
[tab]There’s gonna be sparks a flyin’ tonight!

msg_15:
[color(yellow)]Pale Policeman[color(white)]

msg_16:
[color(yellow)]Pale Policeman[color(white)]
[tab]Lately, kidnappings have been on the rise.
[tab]The witnesses say that men in black take
[tab]people... I wonder if these are organized.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_17:
[color(yellow)]Veteran Policeman[color(white)]
[tab]Katsuya’s still young.
[tab]Even so, he pays for his punk of a younger
[tab]brother, and even takes care of him.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Veteran Policeman[color(white)]
[tab]They say he’s "shrewd" and "too serious",
[tab]but in the end, he ends up sacrificing
[tab]himself to protect something.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_18:
[color(yellow)]Veteran Policeman[color(white)]
[tab]You know Tatsuzou Sudou? There’s been some
[tab]dark rumors about him. Lately, Katsuya’s
[tab]been trying to get to the bottom of it.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Veteran Policeman[color(white)]
[tab]For a guy who is always mellow to become so
[tab]hot when it comes to Tatsuzou... Can only a
[tab]strong sense of justice make him that way?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_19:
[color(yellow)]Veteran Policeman[color(white)]
[tab]The damn captain is the head of the
[tab]inspectors, yet, he doesn’t give us any
[tab]info! And he says we’re unreliable!?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_20:
[color(yellow)]Veteran Policeman[color(white)]
[tab]The Investigative Department is a mess.
[tab]They keep doing irrelevant investigations,
[tab]and intentionally leave us short-handed...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_21:
[color(yellow)]Rookie Policeman[color(white)]
[tab]I want to work hard to become a detective!
[tab]Then I will work hard like Katsuya-san and
[tab]be popular among the female officers...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_22:
[color(yellow)]Rookie Policeman[color(white)]
[tab]But Katsuya-san doesn’t have a girlfriend...
[tab]I guess his work is his love...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_23:
[color(yellow)]Rookie Policeman[color(white)]
[tab]It’s strange. I had a dream that the
[tab]museum was burning. Could it have been
[tab]...a... prophecy...?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_24:
[color(yellow)]Rookie Policeman[color(white)]
[tab]N-No, if that was true,
[tab]this police station should be burning too.
[tab]It, it’s probably nothing.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_25:
[color(yellow)]Rookie Policeman[color(white)]

[tab]still want to assist in the investigations!

msg_26:
[color(yellow)]Rookie Policeman[color(white)]
