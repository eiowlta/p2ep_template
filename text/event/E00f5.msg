[tab][suou]!?
[tab]You’re [suou] from Sevens... right?

msg_1:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Eikichi!?
[tab]Wh-what the hell are you doing in a place like this?!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_2:
He scared me half to death. 
Why was he here...?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_3:
[color(yellow)]Eikichi[color(white)]
[tab]Wh-what’m "I" doing here? 
[tab]What’re YOU doing here? Did you 
[tab]come here with Amano-san and the others?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_4:
So they were here after all... 
Judging by how he phrased it, 
it seemed like he bumped into 
Maya-nee and the others in this research building.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_5:
You’ve gotta be kidding me... 
I was going to have my work cut out for me at this rate.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_6:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]...Yeah. 
[tab]Where did Maya-nee... 
[tab]I mean, Amano-san and the others go?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_7:
[color(yellow)]Eikichi[color(white)]
[tab]I’m not too sure, but they went to investigate 
[tab]somewhere deeper inside this building. 
[tab]Damn, this place is somethin’ else.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_8:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]The guys who were taken here are in the back. 
[tab]Is that everyone?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_9:
I didn’t see any sign of Shiori-san. 
Was she somewhere else...?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_10:
[color(yellow)]Eikichi[color(white)]
[tab]Yeah, these guys are the only ones here. 
[tab]I’m looking for a guy named Sugimoto, myself. 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Eikichi[color(white)]
[tab]I heard they were doin’ human experiments,
[tab]those bastards.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_11:
[color(yellow)]Eikichi[color(white)]
[tab]This guy called Nanjo’s gonna look after ’em 
[tab]at the hospital, so I’m gonna take ’em to the 
[tab]trailer in the parking lot.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_12:
Nanjo? Yukino-san’s acquaintance? 
This place originally belonged to the Nanjo Group.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_13:
If this Nanjo was working with Maya-nee, 
then that might mean that not everyone in 
the company was acting as "his" pawn.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_14:
[color(yellow)]Eikichi[color(white)]
[tab]Hey, you seen Sugimoto? 
[tab]He’s a dude from my school, 
[tab]got a mug only a mother could love.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_15:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]...Don’t know him.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_16:
I couldn’t tell him that I knew his Other Side’s 
self very well. I’d be in trouble if this guy 
didn’t forget everything. 
[wait][clear]Still, Eikichi’s reason for being here suddenly hit me. 
Even on the Other Side, he and Sugimoto 
got on like cats and dogs.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_17:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]So you came here looking for him after he used 
[tab]the Joker curse on you? 
[tab]You’re as soft-hearted as ever.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_18:
[color(yellow)]Eikichi[color(white)]
[tab]...You sure know a lot about me.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_19:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Take this.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_20:
I threw him a badge with the Sevens emblem 
depicted on it. Eikichi caught it and stared at it blankly. 
It should still be effective against Joker Users.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_21:
[color(yellow)]Eikichi[color(white)]
[tab]The hell is this? 
[tab]Don’t tell me you buy that rumor, too?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_22:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Shut up and take it. 
[tab]I’ll stick with you as far as the parking lot.
[tab]Follow me.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_23:
So long as this Eikichi and the synchronized 
Eikichi didn’t remember the Other Side, 
he wouldn’t be able to use his Persona anymore. 
I couldn’t leave him be.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_24:
[color(yellow)]Eikichi[color(white)]
[tab]Hey, thanks. 
[tab]I owe you one, man!
[sync][wait][clear][end]
