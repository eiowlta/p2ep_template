msg_4:
[color(yellow)]Cat Lieutenant General Zula[color(white)]
[tab]The gentleman before you is Nodens, Lord of the 
[tab]Great Abyss, avatar of Master Philemon, who dwells 
[tab]in a far-off region even deeper than this abyss.

[color(green)]In the Elder God’s hand, 
the shining Memory Trapezohedron appeared.[color(white)]
[wait][clear][end]

msg_7:
[color(yellow)]Nodens[color(white)]
[tab]This is the memory of the lost child 
[tab]whom you all seek.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_8:
[color(yellow)]Nodens[color(white)]
[tab]Memory occasionally brings about much distress and 
[tab]suffering, but it is absolutely vital to distinguish oneself 
[tab]from others and manufacture one’s own psyche.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_9:
[color(yellow)]Nodens[color(white)]
[tab]Ever since it began, life’s memory has accumulated 
[tab]unbroken, passing through individual experiences 
[tab]and spanning several generations. 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Nodens[color(white)]
[tab]And so it has given shape to Kadath and the 
[tab]Collective Unconsciousness, thereby becoming 
[tab]a foundation for the next generation.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_10:
[color(yellow)]Nodens[color(white)]
[tab]Even if the roots of the world are directed by 
[tab]fear and anxiety, never forget that the true 
[tab]essence of life is brimming with joy.

msg_11:
[color(yellow)]Nodens[color(white)]
[tab]You must not stop seeking the answer for why 
[tab]life was born in a cosmos progressing towards 
[tab]absurdity and chaos.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_12:
[color(yellow)]Nodens[color(white)]
[tab]Life brims with joy, bringing about balance in a 
[tab]universe predestined to heat death, 
[tab]and that allows the world to live a long time.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_13:
[color(green)]The shining Memory Trapezohedron was left behind

[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]...I dunno what the hell he was talking about, 
[tab]but I guess he was cheering us on?

[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]It’s got nothin’ to do with us, we’re up 
[tab]to our necks in enough bullshit already. 
[tab]Just ignore it.

msg_16:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]I’ve heard about how life is a unique 
[tab]system that decreases entropy.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_17:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]Thermodynamically, the aggregate amount 
[tab]of the energy of the universe is fixed, 
[tab]only the form it takes is different.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_18:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]In a closed room, hot water will eventually cool, 
[tab]but it’s not that the heat is lost: 
[tab]it’s just been dispersed to its surroundings...
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]The total amount of heat in 
[tab]the room has not changed.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_19:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]It’s the same even if you apply this to the universe. 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]It’s said that the universe progresses forward 
[tab]from an orderly to a disorderly state 
[tab]and eventually will reach heat death.

msg_20:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Sudou was saying something like that too...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_21:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]I’ve heard that the only thing that introduces 
[tab]negative entropy, or negentropy, is life. 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]Supposedly it offsets the increase 
[tab]of entropy within its own systems 
[tab]and works towards maintaining order.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_22:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]The reason why the Earth is as full of 
[tab]life as it is now is because life itself 
[tab]brought about order to nature. 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]Nature normally proceeds towards chaos,
[tab]but life produced a change in its environment...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_23:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]...Bring about order so the universe doesn’t die. 
[tab]Does that mean that’s what everyone’s 
[tab]psyche’s for?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_24:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Yeah, but maybe we think that’s a valid 
[tab]way of thinking ’cause it’s us thinking it.
[tab]Try to remember where this place is.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_25:
[tab]Try to remember where this place is.
[choice(2)]Yeah, there’s meaning to life!
Yeah, there’s no meaning to life!

msg_26:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]That’s what I’d like to believe. 
[tab]At the very least, that way is more positive.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_27:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]Let’s think positive, right?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

[color(green)]Maya and the others obtained 200 [var(msg_var_0)] cards.[color(white)]
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_29:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]That’s also the truth, basically: we got no idea 
[tab]what the truth is. Nothing for it but choosing 
[tab]your convictions and way of life yourself.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_30:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]...Yeah.
