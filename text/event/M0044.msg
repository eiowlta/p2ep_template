There are more than 4 in the party.
[tab]It will hang at this rate.
[tab]Please inform Kaneda and Kataoka.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_1:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]This is quite a room. I bet you played
[tab]fortress in your treehouse as a kid. Hmm,
[tab]what’s this button do? [delay(15)]Switch on!
[wait][clear][end]

msg_2:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]Is tapping really that enjoyable?
[tab]Is it like reading someone else’s diary...?
[tab]But, that’s kind of wrong...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_3:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]When it involves that assassin, Bao’s mood
[tab]totally changes...
[tab]He definitely loses his cool.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_4:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]And then he treats people like kids.
[tab]It’s so embarrassing.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_5:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]Baofu’s real name is Kaoru, huh? And he
[tab]is still holding on to memories of a woman
[tab]from the past... I see.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_6:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]Hey Ma-ya, are you okay? You look so pale!
[tab]Is it because [tatsuya]-kun is hiding something?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_7:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]I wonder if I was I tricked by him on the
[tab]"Other Side" too. Hmm, I kind of want to
[tab]know, but at the same time, I don’t...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_8:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]I was tricked by him on the "Other Side"
[tab]after all... Huh... Just like Ma-ya’s
[tab]flashback...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_9:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]So this is Baofu’s place... It figures.
[tab]A detective in an old TV show I watched
[tab]as a child had a room like this.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_10:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]Hey, Baofu! What are these targets
[tab]doing on the wall!? Are you doing some
[tab]killing along with your tapping...?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_11:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Of course not! ...You know this business
[tab]comes with certain risks, right?
[tab]It’s for self-defense!
[wait][clear][end]

msg_12:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]...Baofu...
[tab]He too is a man who lives by
[tab]carrying sorrow from his past.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_13:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]I was hesitant to research someone’s past,
[tab]but it was an issue of trusting Baofu...
[tab]I mean, Saga. It couldn’t be helped.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_14:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]...Yes, Amano-kun? [tatsuya]?
[tab]...He tells me nothing. I wonder what
[tab][tatsuya] is hiding from us.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_15:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]No matter what [tatsuya] says, I am still
[tab][tatsuya]’s brother! I will not let him suffer
[tab]any longer!
[wait][clear][end]

msg_16:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Let’s make the most of this. There’s
[tab]no guarantee that it is safe here either...
[tab][delay(15)]Um? [delay(15)]... Ahhh! Serizawa, don’t touch that!!
[wait][clear][end]

msg_17:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]...Geez... I wish these
[tab]guys would cut it out.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_18:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]What is it, Amano...?
[tab]You want to tell me something too?
[tab]Spare me the gloomy stuff, alright?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_19:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Hmm... I wonder what [suou]’s little
[tab]brother is hiding... I’m curious about it.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_20:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]My counterpart from the "Other Side", eh.
[tab]I’m not very interested... I’m not childish
[tab]enough to expect anything from it.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_21:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]It seems I was collecting rumors over
[tab]there too. Not very different from here...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_22:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]At one time, I was kinda curious about an
[tab]alternate world... But it’s actually pretty
[tab]boring.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_23:
[color(yellow)]Nanjo[color(white)]
[tab]Mr. Baofu seems to work alone also. He keeps
[tab]his gun skills sharp... I guess in this day
[tab]and age, it becomes common practice.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_24:
[color(yellow)]Nanjo[color(white)]
[tab]...I was just being naive.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_25:
[color(yellow)]Nanjo[color(white)]
[tab]Invasion of privacy is not acceptable and
[tab]neither is disclosing it. I don’t know why
[tab]people reveal their diaries on the net.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_26:
[color(yellow)]Nanjo[color(white)]
[tab]...Conversation and behavior that
[tab]doesn’t reveal the past...
[tab]That must be Mr. Baofu’s forte.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_27:
[color(yellow)]Nanjo[color(white)]
[tab]Not knowing sorrow is the same as
[tab]not knowing pleasure...
[tab]Mr. Baofu... He knows that too well.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_28:
[color(yellow)]Nanjo[color(white)]
[tab]Is Mr. Baofu really going to pull out of this
[tab]incident?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_29:
[color(yellow)]Nanjo[color(white)]
[tab]Whatever [suou]’s reason for fighting is,
[tab]I cannot quit after coming this far.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_30:
[color(yellow)]Elly[color(white)]
[tab]Maybe Kei’s right. We both underestimated
[tab]the New World Order.
[tab]We just realized it now...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_31:
[color(yellow)]Elly[color(white)]
[tab]Speaking of tapping, some of the models
[tab]said a stalker set tapping devices in their
[tab]rooms. Could it be that Mr. Baofu helped...!?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_32:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Hell no!
[tab]My targets are only ones with
[tab]a dark rumor.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_33:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]I’d never help a weenie little stalker!
[wait][clear][end]

msg_34:
[color(yellow)]Elly[color(white)]
[tab]Mr. Baofu would know that this information is
[tab]a trap... Yet he is going in.
[tab]That takes a lot of courage.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_35:
[color(yellow)]Elly[color(white)]
[tab]I felt anger and sorrow from Mr. Baofu’s
[tab]Persona. It had something to do with
[tab]the death of a person...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_36:
[color(yellow)]Elly[color(white)]
[tab]What is it that [tatsuya] knows? The
[tab]nervous face he makes when he is asked
[tab]about it... Ms. Amano, any ideas?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_37:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]...The answers are at Alaya Shrine.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_38:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]If you go to Mt. Iwato,
[tab]you’ll find out everything...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_39:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]I’m sorry... Because of me...
