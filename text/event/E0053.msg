[color(yellow)]Brown[color(white)]
[tab]And about the other thing...
[tab]It seems that the fortune telling show,
[tab]which started the boom, was a set-up...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_7:
[color(yellow)]Yukino[color(white)]
[tab]That was about the time when a bunch of

[tab]Kurosu-san... you didn’t do the
[tab]Joker curse, right?
[tab]Is everyone gonna become a Joker!?

msg_15:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]That whim cats have, and the way they
[tab]check things out is just so... Ahh... CHOO...
[tab]Just thinking about it gives me allergies.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_16:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]Junko Kurosu became a Joker...
[tab]That’s what the Assistant Director on
[tab]the 6th floor said. What does that mean?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_17:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]So, let’s go unmask a witch...

msg_25:
[color(yellow)]Fujii[color(white)]
[tab]She has the look of a model, but she is
[tab]not too popular with the camera crew
[tab]because they say her smile is "stiff"...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_26:
[color(yellow)]Fujii[color(white)]
