[tab]You live up to your reputation, Paradox Boy. 
[tab]However, you’re still young.

msg_1:
I scythed the point of my sword right and left, 
aiming for his neck, but Kandori danced back 
half a step and evaded it.

[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]How do I turn Shiori-san back to normal?!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_3:
I scythed my blade to the left but couldn’t pull back, 
so I shoved the pommel forward with my left palm 
and aimed a stab for his upper lip.

msg_4:
[color(yellow)]Kandori[color(white)]
[tab]I’ll give you a hint.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_5:
Kandori tilted his face out of the way, 
and when my blade grazed his ear, 
he grabbed it with his left hand. 
[wait][clear]All I had to do was pull back, 
and it’d cost him his fingers. 
He gave me a broad, natural smile.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_6:
However, even when I yanked it with all my strength, 
my sword didn’t move a centimeter. 
It was like it was caught in a vise.

msg_7:
[color(yellow)]Kandori[color(white)]
[tab]Creation is the synthesis of contradictions. 
[tab]When difficult and conflicting things coexist 
[tab]and become one, something new is born.

msg_8:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]The hell does that mean?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_9:
[color(yellow)]Kandori[color(white)]
[tab]It means that both you and I are   
[tab]merely actors playing our roles. 
[tab]However, there is nothing degrading about this. 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Kandori[color(white)]
[tab]The process is essential to the result.

[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Shut up! You’re just an errand boy!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_11:
[color(yellow)]Kandori[color(white)]
[tab]Hmph... If you wish to save Shiori Miyashiro, 
[tab]seek out a suitable place for her. 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Kandori[color(white)]
[tab]Assuming, of course, that you suppose
[tab]you’re capable of obtaining all of her 
[tab]contradictory values at once.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_12:
He struck the instant I stopped to think about 
what he had said. Kandori’s right hand slammed
into my side and knocked the wind out of me.
[wait][clear]While I was staggered, he leapt light-footed 
over the railing and jumped down to the floor below.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_13:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Wait!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_14:
[color(yellow)]Kandori[color(white)]
[tab]Think it over long and hard as you 
[tab]play your little games.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_15:
Kandori looked up at me, baoding balls in his hand 
held aloft, then passed through the door 
downstairs and disappeared.
