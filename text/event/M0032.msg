msg_9:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]You can’t say that it is legal,

[tab]Why don’t you try talking to him?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_10:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]I understand that this situation we are

msg_11:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]If my testimony, that of a fellow

msg_17:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]"D五j二 vu" is just the mind playing tricks...
[tab]It occurs when the brain confuses recent
[tab]memories with past memories.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_18:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]That’s why several people
[tab]don’t have one chance in a million to
[tab]experience the same "d五j二 vu".
[wait][clear][end]

msg_19:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]If that does happen, then it means
[tab]it’s something other than "d五j二 vu"...
[tab]I don’t know what that something is, though.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_20:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
