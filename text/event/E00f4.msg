[tab]Maya-nee, you still haven’t given up...?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_3:
When I jumped the security fence and reached 
what looked like the security room for the 
research lab, I found the security guards had already 
been overcome and the alarms and monitors cut. 
[wait][clear]No wonder it was so easy for me to sneak in.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_4:
I found three warped coins on the floor next to the 
security guards collapsed in front of the door.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_5:
There was only one person who could 
take out gun-toting enemies with 
something like that: Baofu, that shady old man.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_6:
Which meant Maya-nee and my brother were here, too. 
They were probably a step ahead of me and got wind 
that the kidnapped Joker Users were dragged here. 
This was going to be a pain.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_7:
Two full days had passed since I left 
Shiori-san’s place and tracked the 
rumors to this place. 
[wait][clear]In that time, Shiori-san hadn’t returned 
home or to the police station. 
There was no mistake, "his" underlings 
had kidnapped her.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_8:
All over town, people who used the Joker curse 
had been turning into Joker-users and, 
for some reason, getting kidnapped just as 
quickly by some unknown party.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_9:
I needed to simultaneously rescue Shiori-san, 
Maya-nee and the others, and figure out who 
the guys hunting down Joker Users really were. 
[wait][clear]They were the pawns "he" was using 
in place of the Masked Circle.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_10:
I’d knock out all three tasks at once. 
[wait][clear]If possible, I wanted to get my hands on the 
information here before Maya-nee and the others did, 
then erase my tracks so they wouldn’t get in any deeper 
than they already had... Could I do it?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_11:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]No. I WILL do it.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_12:
[color(green)]There’s no time to go back.[color(white)]
