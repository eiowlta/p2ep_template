msg_1:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]Why are they all like, "Let’s think positive"
[tab]just from being brainwashed?
[tab]It’s like tons of Ma-yas running around!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_2:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]Oh my...
[tab]They’re all talking about the Torifune
[tab]here too? What should we do?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_3:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]I wonder why [tatsuya]-kun avoids you so
[tab]much, Ma-ya? Do you think it’s his way
[tab]of showing affection?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_4:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]Oh... sorry.
[tab]I’m just kidding.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_5:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]It seems that [tatsuya]-kun is the type of
[tab]guy who tries to do everything himself.
[tab]...He probably has his reasons.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_6:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]That even makes ME blush.
[tab]I think you’re pretty fortunate, Ma-ya.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_7:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab](giggle) I should’ve gone to that party!
[tab]I would’ve found a great guy already...
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]And look at the mess I’m in now...
[tab]I’m telling you...
[tab]It only happens to me!
[wait][clear][end]

msg_8:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]No matter what, he is only human.
[tab]Humans can make mistakes...
[tab]But how far can the law punish a person...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_9:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]The Nanjo information network is amazing.
[tab]They’ve spread the Torifune story
[tab]so quickly...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_10:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]As you grow up, even brothers get issues
[tab]they don’t want to discuss with each other.
[tab]But there is something unusual about him.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_11:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab][tatsuya] doesn’t look well...
[tab]What more does he plan to show us?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_12:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab][tatsuya] from another world...
[tab]Either way, he is my younger brother.
[tab]I won’t act differently towards him.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_13:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]The same voice, the same look...
[tab]How could I believe that he’s not
[tab]my brother?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_14:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab][tatsuya] might be able to understand my
[tab]father’s feelings right now...
[tab]I hope that one day he would tell me.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_15:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]If they can brainwash so many at once...
[tab]How long would it take to brainwash
[tab]everyone in Sumaru City?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_16:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]No matter what kind of reality the
[tab]rumors can create, we just have
[tab]to get them directly. Right?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_17:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]They seem to have special regards
[tab]for that [tatsuya]...
[tab]Why is that...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_18:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]I hate to be kept in suspense, 
[tab]so I want secrets or whatever told 
[tab]to me already. What is at Mt. Iwato?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_19:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Hey, Amano... we’re on the verge
[tab]of knowing the secret to your
[tab]"D五j二 Vu", you know?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_20:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]We should head back.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_21:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]The Paradox... and the "Other Side"...
[tab]I get it. Now I understand
[tab]what they were saying.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_22:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]How can the owner of this place be
[tab]so positive without being brainwashed...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_23:
[color(yellow)]Nanjo[color(white)]
[tab]A device that takes human evil... Without
[tab]Kandori, it would not have been completed.
[tab]But I didn’t know they made more...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_24:
[color(yellow)]Nanjo[color(white)]
[tab]World destruction because of Wang Long...
[tab]Ameno Torifune... these aren’t things
[tab]that normal people would believe.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_25:
[color(yellow)]Nanjo[color(white)]
[tab]The events that the New World Order
[tab]caused served as a stepping stone for this
[tab]information manipulation. We’re such fools!
[wait][clear][end]

msg_26:
[color(yellow)]Nanjo[color(white)]
[tab]...[suou]’s eyes remind me of him...
[tab]Kandori’s eyes...
[tab]...I don’t know why I feel that way...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_27:
[color(yellow)]Nanjo[color(white)]
[tab]Alaya Shrine...
[tab]and Mt. Iwato...
[tab]What is he trying to show us...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_28:
[color(yellow)]Nanjo[color(white)]
[tab]Mr. Baofu is right.
[tab]This is not only your problem.
[tab]We should go back.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_29:
[color(yellow)]Elly[color(white)]
[tab]It seems that person had been brainwashed
[tab]at a place other than Smile Hirasaka...
[tab]We must get to the root of it all.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_30:
[color(yellow)]Elly[color(white)]
[tab]I can’t believe that our actions would
[tab]lead to this...
[tab]We must think of something to do!
[wait][clear][end]

msg_31:
[color(yellow)]Elly[color(white)]
[tab]Strangely, [tatsuya] seems familiar.
[tab]Could I have met him before..?

[tab]Please... just leave me alone...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_35:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]I would rather you back out now...
[tab]You’re better off not knowing
[tab]certain things.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_36:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]...If Jun and Eikichi regain their memory,
[tab]this world will cease to exist...
[tab]I can’t let that happen!
