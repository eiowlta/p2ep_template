[color(yellow)]Nyarlathotep[color(white)]
[tab]I am the shadow of humanity. As long as there
[tab]is darkness in your hearts, I’ll never go away.
[tab]Behold the Crawling Chaos’ final ordeal!

[color(yellow)]Philemon[color(white)]
[tab]There is one way left to change things...
[tab]To erase the fact of your meeting on that
[tab]summer evening...

msg_3:
[color(yellow)]Philemon[color(white)]
[tab]The first strings in his wicked web of
[tab]fate were spun on that day...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_4:
[color(yellow)]Philemon[color(white)]
[tab]If that one point ceases to exist, 
[tab]it will give rise to an alternate timeline, 
[tab]one which does not lead to this tragedy...

msg_7:
[color(yellow)]Philemon[color(white)]
[tab]Even without the illusions of Xibalba and the
[tab]crystal skulls, your strong wills are enough

msg_8:
[color(yellow)]Philemon[color(white)]
[tab]Yes... The power that created your world is
[tab]the same as your inner strength... In this
[tab]collective unconsciousness, it is possible.

msg_9:
[color(yellow)]Jun[color(white)]
[tab]Are you saying... we can reset everything...?
[tab]In exchange for all of it... our memories

msg_10:
[color(yellow)]Ginko[color(white)]
[tab]Does that mean I’ll forget everyone...!?
[tab]No... No, I don’t want that!
[tab]Isn’t there any other way!?

msg_11:
[color(yellow)]Philemon[color(white)]
[tab]There is none here, in the seat of his power.
[tab]He draws strength from the negative emotions
[tab]of people unconsciously desiring destruction...

msg_12:
[color(yellow)]Philemon[color(white)]
[tab]If you are to stop him, then mankind itself
[tab]must change... You must create this new world.

[tab]Damn straight...
[tab]I’m not gonna let myself

msg_15:
[color(yellow)]Eikichi[color(white)]
[tab]If that bastard set all of this up, then let’s
[tab]do this... We’ll show him that not everything
[tab]goes his way.

msg_16:
[color(yellow)]Ginko[color(white)]
[tab]We’ll...
[tab]meet again, won’t we...?

[tab]Just a little something for luck...
[tab]I’m sure I won’t forget you now, [tatsuya]...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_19:
[color(yellow)]Philemon[color(white)]
[tab]Now... We will not see each other again for
[tab]some time. Is there anything you would like
[tab]to say before you go?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

[tab]that you break through the unwritten laws of
[tab]destiny and remember each other... Farewell.

msg_22:
[color(yellow)]Philemon[color(white)]
[tab]I am Philemon, a dweller in the rift between
[tab]consciousness and unconsciousness of all
[tab]souls...
[sync][wait][clear][end]
