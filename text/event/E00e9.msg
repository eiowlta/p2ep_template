On the Other Side, the hallway had a cheap-looking 
upholstery spangled with constellations to match 
Club Zodiac’s name. Here, it had been changed to 
Chinese-style red upholstery.

msg_1:
Nakamura had said the proprietor had changed.
I wondered if they were trying to set up a 
Chinese restaurant in the interior. 
[wait][clear]Then a few winged monsters I’d never seen 
before dropped down from the hallway ceiling.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_2:
They were not altogether hornets, 
nor crabs, nor ants, nor vampire bats. 
But creatures unpleasantly, horrifically eerie.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_3:
If I wasn’t awakened to my Persona, 
just looking upon them might have driven me 
mad and sent me screaming from the room. 
[wait][clear]That’s how big of a punch they packed.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_4:
They snapped back their wings with a whip-like crack, 
and a malicious buzz started emanating from 
their abdomens, which were swollen like a hornet’s. 
[wait][clear]They had mouths on what looked to be their heads, 
but it seemed like their voices came from below.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_5:
I couldn’t quite pronounce it correctly myself, 
but I heard noises like "Bee-yack-ee!" 
or "Bye-ack-hay!" and "Ia! Ia! Hastur!" 
[wait][clear]At any rate, they were probably "his" bright idea. 
This meant that there would be 
demons past this point.

[tab]You’re telling me to do a warm-up, huh? 
[tab]Sorry, but I’m not gonna waste my time  
[tab]swatting flies. Get out here, now.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_7:
When I grumbled that to "him," who was watching from 
somewhere, they made that grating Ia! Ia! noise from 
their abdomens simultaneously, then flew with 
incredible vigor through the narrow hallway at me.
