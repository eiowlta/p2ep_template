msg_3:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Maya, with the name of Maya Okamura, died...
[tab]The prophecy fulfilled... The world destroyed...

msg_5:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]In the world of the Collective Unconsciousness,
[tab]where we fought him, strong beliefs become
[tab]reality...

msg_6:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]By resetting our meeting 10 years ago,
[tab]we created another reality in exchange for
[tab]the truths and memories until then...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_7:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]So that’s this reality...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_8:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Maya-nee told us to forget about her...
[tab]To accept everything and move on...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_9:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]But... we couldn’t stand it...
[end]

msg_10:
[tab]That’s why we made this reality, to trade
[tab]for our memories, and we escaped here...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_11:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Hanging on to a faint hope... to remember...

[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_15:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]But... I...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_16:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]So that’s why Amano and that Jun kid
[tab]don’t remember about the Other Side...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_17:
[color(yellow)]Elly[color(white)]
[tab]We don’t have a memory of the "Other Side",
[tab]because we are natives of "This Side"...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_18:
[color(yellow)]Nanjo[color(white)]
[tab]No wonder we natives of "This Side"
[tab]don’t have a memory of the "Other Side"...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_19:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]But, that could change...
[tab]"He" said that I was "the Paradox"...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_20:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]This reality exists on the concept of 
[tab]resetting the memories of us five...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_21:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]If we all regain our memories, the
[tab]distortion between the two worlds will
[tab]grow... And this world will cease to exist...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_22:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]I don’t want Maya-nee to be involved anymore...
[tab]I’m sure you understand now...

[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_27:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]No...[delay(30)]
