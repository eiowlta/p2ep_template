[tab]a money-grubbing fairy!
[wait][clear][end]

msg_3:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]This place is expensive as usual. Wouldn’t it be 
[tab]nice to get a discount once in a while? Do you think 
[tab]I could pressure her into giving us a loyalty card?

msg_5:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]Places where an incident occurs have

[wait][clear][end]

msg_6:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]There are even stories going around

msg_8:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]

msg_10:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]A money-grubbing fairy and talkative
[tab]demons... After all of this and all those
[tab]ghost stories, they seem like lies, huh?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_11:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]But, there was one story that’s
[tab]really scary. Even I couldn’t sleep.
[tab]I’ll tell ya when I feel like it.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_12:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]A fairy with a greed for money... huh.
[tab]Hmph, what an empty dream. In the end,
[tab]dreams are just people’s delusions...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_13:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]She sure knows how to appears anywhere, 
[tab]that miser. Now if she could use that ability 
[tab]to transport us, that’d be something.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Well, she’d probably charge 
[tab]more than a midnight cab though.

msg_14:
[color(yellow)]Nanjo[color(white)]

[tab]a fountain everywhere we go?
[tab]She has much more mobility than us...

msg_15:
[color(yellow)]Nanjo[color(white)]
[tab]We too have been through hard times due to
[tab]that fairy... She seems to have grown a
[tab]little, but her greed is just as before...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_16:
[color(yellow)]Nanjo[color(white)]
[tab]Good grief, I never thought I would meet her again.
[tab]If I don’t keep an eye on her, The Nanjo 
[tab]conglomerate could be completely crushed...

[color(yellow)]Elly[color(white)]
[tab]No matter how injured we are, she
[tab]won’t heal us unless we have money.
[tab]I’d understand if she were a demon, but...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_20:
[color(yellow)]Elly[color(white)]
[tab]I wonder when she’ll be able to go home...
[tab]If she goes back, could we have a 
[tab]pure-hearted fairy in her stead?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_23:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Will the day ever come that that fairy does 
[tab]a true good deed? Maybe she doesn’t
[tab]realize it because no one’s told her?
[wait][clear][color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]...Should we say something?
