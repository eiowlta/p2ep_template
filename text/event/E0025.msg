[tab]Now, that’s something you don’t
[tab]do everyday...

msg_1:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]...!?
[tab][tatsuya]...!?
[tab]Has anyone seen [tatsuya]!?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_2:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Calm down... He’s been through a lot
[tab]more than you... He probably avoided us
[tab]and went ashore somewhere else...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_3:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]You... How do you know [tatsuya]?
[tab]He seemed to know you...
[tab]What is this "Other Side"?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_4:
[color(yellow)]Jun[color(white)]
[tab]I don’t know...
[tab]I just feel I know him from long ago...
[tab]Just a feeling he was someone important...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_5:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]I see...

[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]But, the Joker is dead now, right?
[tab]It’s over...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_7:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]Ahh, I’m so relieved.
[tab]I can finally get on with
[tab]my miserable life!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_8:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Moron... Nothing is over yet... We still
[tab]don’t know what Tatsuzou intends to do.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_9:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]For once, he’s actually right...
[tab]We haven’t learned anything about
[tab]the Sudou family, Joker or [tatsuya]...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_10:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]It’s unfortunate that the suspect is dead...
[tab]I should let HQ know...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_11:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Haven’t you learned anything, [suou]?
[tab]You can’t depend on the police...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_12:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]Say that again...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_13:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]You’re not only hard-headed, but hard of
[tab]hearing, too? Or, is it just that you can’t
[tab]do anything without your badge?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_14:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Hmph! That’s what I thought... Do you really
[tab]think you can catch Tatsuzou by yourself?
[tab]Good luck...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_15:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]Say what you will Baofu... Just stay
[tab]out of my way, OR you’ll find yourself in
[tab]the slammer with Tatsuzou.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_16:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]I don’t know about you, but I’m quitting
[tab]while I’m ahead.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_17:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]Ma-ya, don’t get involved... I don’t think
[tab]I could handle it if you got hurt...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_18:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Cowards! What are you afraid of!?
[tab]The truth is all that matters!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_19:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Don’t tell me you’re quitting, too?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_20:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Heh... Good for you... I’m gonna head back
[tab]to my place to see if I can get a bead on
[tab]Tatsuzou...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_21:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]See if any of your friends at Kismet know anything...
[tab]I’ll swing by and pick you up later.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

[color(yellow)]Jun[color(white)]
[tab][tatsuya] [suou]...
[tab]Who are you...?
