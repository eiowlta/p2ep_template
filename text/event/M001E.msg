[tab]First off, we use coins for most things.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Manager[color(white)]
[tab]Talk to me and select "Buy coins" and I’ll
[tab]give you coins to play the games in exchange
[tab]for cash.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Manager[color(white)]
[tab]But it only works one way. You can’t exchange
[tab]coins for money.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Manager[color(white)]
[tab]What you can do is redeem them for prizes.
[tab]Talk to me and select "Redeem for prizes"
[tab]when you want to do that.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Manager[color(white)]
[tab]You can only spend the coins you win here
[tab]on our prizes, so I’d advise you to use
[tab]them well.
