[tab]Though Personas are your hidden sides, it must
[tab]come as a surprise that you can get in touch
[tab]with this unconscious aspect of yourself.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]No one can fully harness a Persona’s power
[tab]from the start.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]This is especially true of newer Personas...
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Thus, a Persona will have only a small portion
[tab]of its true power at the outset.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]But the more you invoke a Persona, the more
[tab]adept you become at it. It will gain more
[tab]abilities, more powerful attacks.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Of course, that is just the fruit of being
[tab]able to fully utilize a Persona. The SP 
[tab]needed to invoke it will not change.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]The nuances are somewhat different from your
[tab]own growth, but it may be best to think of
[tab]this as a Persona’s growth.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]A Persona’s growth occurs in eight stages. At 
[tab]each stage, a change will occur in the Persona.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Personas will also have a slight effect on 
[tab]your own growth.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]The way it affects your growth depends on the 
[tab]type of Persona you take on. Remember this.

msg_107:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]A Persona is your other self... All Personas 
[tab]are connected to you...
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Still, some are close resemblances to your 
[tab]psyche, while others are quite distant.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]You may not be able to control a Persona if 
[tab]your connection to it is weak. Indeed, you 
[tab]may not be able to take it on at all.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]The reverse of this is that the closer they 
[tab]are to you, the easier it is to use them. This 
[tab]can be seen in the cost of invoking them.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]In some cases, invoking a skill will cost less 
[tab]SP than usual. But these circumstances will 
[tab]not be the same for everyone.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]You should experiment and see for yourself.

[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Tarot Cards are necessary for a medium like
[tab]myself to summon new Personas.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Personas are classified according to the
[tab]Arcana of the Tarot, such as Magician and
[tab]Emperor...
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]If you wish to summon a Sun Persona, you will
[tab]need cards of that Arcana.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]The number of Tarot Cards required varies
[tab]depending on the Persona’s level.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Indeed, the higher the Persona’s level, the
[tab]more Tarot Cards are necessary to summon it.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Demons possess the Tarot Cards you need...
[tab]The cards they carry will be the same Arcana
[tab]as the demon itself.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Your task, then, is to collect Tarot Cards
[tab]from demons of the same Arcana as the Persona
[tab]you wish to summon.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]But contacting the same demons over and over
[tab]will do you little good. Higher-level demons
[tab]will possess more Tarot Cards.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]The best way to summon a high-level Persona
[tab]is to negotiate with equally high-level demons.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Some Tarot Cards, however, are held by
[tab]no demons.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]When you find Free Tarot Cards, consult the
[tab]Demon Painter over there.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Ah, yes, one final caveat: Even with the
[tab]requisite number of cards, you cannot summon
[tab]Personas that are five levels higher than you.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Do keep that in mind...

[tab]When I summon a Persona, you may choose to
[tab]add a Material Card.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Only one Material Card can be used per
[tab]summoning. By adding these cards, I can
[tab]summon special Personas.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]The Personas that correspond to your Material
[tab]Cards will be shown in blue on the summoning
[tab]list.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Material Cards are essential components in
[tab]creating powerful Personas...

msg_110:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]I can add a Skill Card at the moment of
[tab]summoning, if you choose.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Only one Skill Card can be used per summoning.
[tab]The newly summoned Persona will learn the
[tab]skill sealed within the card.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]For instance... Add an Agi Card when summoning
[tab]a new Persona, and that Persona will learn Agi.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Even skills they would not normally learn can
[tab]be taught with these cards.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Mind you, there are degrees of compatibility
[tab]between Skill Cards and Personas. If it’s low,
[tab]I cannot add the Skill Card.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Demons possess many of these Skill Cards.
[tab]The best way to obtain them would be through
[tab]negotiation with these demons...
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]There are rare Skill Cards as well, which can
[tab]be obtained in several ways. I suggest you
[tab]experiment for yourself.

msg_111:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]If you wish it, I can add Incense Cards you

[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Only one Incense Card can be used in any
[tab]given summoning. It will increase the
[tab]statistics of that Persona.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]These can only be used at the time of
[tab]summoning, so I recommend thinking it
[tab]through before adding one...

[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]And remember, too, that the Personas you take
[tab]on count towards this limit.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]The power of Persona is crucial to your
[tab]journey. I recommend switching Personas
[tab]depending on the situation at hand.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]I will take good care of newly summoned
[tab]Personas here.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]I, too, have my limit, but I can hold onto
[tab]Personas in your possession along with newly

[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]

[tab]My duty is to summon new Personas. I use the

[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]The more Tarot Cards you supply me, the higher
[tab]level Personas I can summon.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]However... Gathering Tarot Cards alone will
[tab]not be sufficient to summon every Persona.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Some require special conditions to be summoned.
[tab]They slumber at the depths of the unconscious
[tab]mind... You will need a way to awaken them.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]One such way is to summon them with the use
[tab]of Material Cards.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Beyond that, the growth of Personas may be
[tab]another way... I suggest you experiment and

[tab]unconsciousness here in the Velvet Room...
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Their powers will be released. In return, they

[tab]When you use Fusion Spells frequently, in some

[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]The probability of this mutation is greatly
[tab]affected by your compatibility with the
[tab]Persona...
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]The better your compatibility, the higher the
[tab]chances of it mutating.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]The details of these mutations differ according
[tab]to the Persona’s rank. A low-level Persona may
[tab]simply mutate into Rank 2 or gain a few points.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]But a higher-ranked Persona may mutate to
[tab]learn new skills... Depending on the Persona,
[tab]it may become an entirely different Persona.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]It’s possible for some Personas to turn into

[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Demons aren’t so unlike you. They know joy,
[tab]anger, and other emotions... You can talk to
[tab]them by making contact.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]A demon’s feelings can be measured through
[tab]its words, wounds, actions, and also a gauge.
[tab]I’ll explain how to read the emotion gauge...
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Happiness is represented as a green field. When
[tab]this emotion is at its highest, you can form a
[tab]pact with the demon.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]There are several benefits to forming pacts
[tab]with demons.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]They may give you rare Tarot Cards or tell you
[tab]interesting stories.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Demons you have pacts with will not give you
[tab]these things of their own will, however. You
[tab]must contact them again.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Next, anger is represented as a red field.
[tab]When this emotion is at its peak, negotiations
[tab]with the demon will be immediately cut off.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]When this happens, demons will no longer
[tab]listen. In the worst case, they will attack.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]This can also happen to demons you have a
[tab]pact with. It is highly inadvisable. I suggest
[tab]you do not anger them.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Next, fear is represented as a blue field.
[tab]When this emotion is at its height, the demon
[tab]will become frightened and run away.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Finally, eagerness is represented as a yellow
[tab]field. There is special significance in
[tab]raising this emotion to its highest level.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]For it is then that you can obtain Tarot
[tab]Cards, which are necessary in my summonings.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Summoning powerful Personas will require many
[tab]Tarot Cards, so it’s best to contact demons
[tab]frequently to collect them...
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Remember that happiness, anger, and fear may
[tab]increase alongside a demon’s eagerness.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]If happiness and eagerness reach critical levels
[tab]at the same time, for instance, you will not be
[tab]able to form a pact.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]And should anger or fear reach their peak at
[tab]the same time as eagerness, another unusual
[tab]result will occur.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]There are normally three stages of each
[tab]emotion. My advice would be to try and focus
[tab]on increasing a single emotion.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]That should cover the basics, I think. There
[tab]will be times when demons will ask questions
[tab]of you or open the battle by contacting you.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]But I’m sure you’ll figure all of this out
[tab]for yourself during your struggles...

msg_117:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Well then, allow me to explain what I know of
[tab]demon personalities.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]It’s as true of demons as it is of humans:
there are many different kinds.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Wise demons, snappish demons, timid demons...
[tab]Each has its own likes and dislikes.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]You must be mindful of these differences and
[tab]make contact with the demons.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Their personalities can be divided into eight
[tab]classifications: wise, foolish, joyful, timid,
[tab]forceful, gloomy, snappish, and haughty...
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Each demon has one or more of these qualities.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]The combination of these qualities will cause
[tab]their reactions to vary wildly when making
[tab]contact.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]There’s no knowing what a demon’s personality
[tab]is like if you’ve never contacted it, but once
[tab]you make contact, it will be apparent.
