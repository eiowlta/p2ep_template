Around the center of the lab, there was a demon  
restrained on a revolving lab table set upright. 
It hung its head like a crucified sinner.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_1:
Its blood-red hair was long as a shroud and cloaked its 
face from view. Its overall form looked human enough, 
but its skin color was difficult to describe beyond 
that it was clearly not of this world.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_2:
If it were so inclined, the talons on both its hands 
could easily tear through the lab table on which 
it was restrained along with the men in white standing 
on either side of it. 
[wait][clear]It looked like it had been sedated or something.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_3:
The men in white seemed to have noticed my arrival. 
They backed away several steps, but somehow, 
they didn’t seem too surprised. 
[wait][clear]There was no one else in the room. 
A horrific premonition skittered up my spine.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_4:
Glaring at the men in white, I barged straight 
in while thrusting the gun at them. 
I stole a clipboard holding a chart from the 
narrow-eyed man and looked it over.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_5:
On the chart the process of Shiori-san’s 
metamorphosis into a demon was documented 
via a series of photos.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_6:
By deliberately allowing a Persona to take over, 
they transformed her into a demon. 
[wait][clear]It seemed like this was an experiment to change a 
person into a demon by swapping a demonic archetype 
sleeping in the Collective Unconsciousness 
with a human consciousness.

[tab]...Tch!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_8:
I uttered a wordless scream and landed two blows 
on the leg of the middle-aged man trembling 
next to the narrow-eyed man.
[wait][clear]As he squealed like a pig and crumpled, 
I grabbed the narrow-eyed man by the collar 
and slammed him onto the operating table.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_9:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Change her back! 
[tab]Right now!!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_10:
I put pressure on the narrow-eyed man’s 
throat with my left arm and pressed the muzzle 
between his eyes as I shouted.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_11:
[color(yellow)]Narrow-eyed Man in a White Coat[color(white)]
[tab]I-I can’t!
[tab]I was only entrusted with elapsed 
[tab]observation and anesthetic management, and...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_12:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Then who CAN?! 
[tab]Who the hell thought up this bullshit?!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_13:
[color(yellow)]Narrow-eyed Man in a White Coat[color(white)]
[tab]T-Takahisa Kandori...! 
[tab]Kandori supplied the theory! 
[tab]R-right now, he’s going by the name Shinjo...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_14:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Where the hell is he?!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_15:
[color(yellow)]Narrow-eyed Man in a White Coat[color(white)]
[tab]J-just up ahead... At the JSM...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_16:
The narrow-eyed man pointed a finger trembling 
with terror and oxygen deprivation at the inner door. 
[wait][clear]I wanted to kill him. 
All these bastards should die. 
I couldn’t stop myself from putting more 
strength into the arm holding him by his throat.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_17:
[color(yellow)]Narrow-eyed Man in a White Coat[color(white)]
[tab]Gugh...
[tab]Guha...!
[wait][clear][end]

msg_18:
The narrow-eyed man’s eyes popped open, 
and his tongue lolled out as he gasped for breath. 
He tried to peel my arm off with both hands, but what 
did he think he could do when he was that weak?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_19:
"Do it. Crush the life out of him."
A dusky impulse blew up from the bottom of my heart 
and became a black flame. The bruise "he" left on me 
ached as if it was being squeezed on right now.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_20:
At my back, I heard a series of intermittent 
metallic clanks, then the sound of something 
heavy thudding onto the floor. 
[wait][clear]I returned to my senses, and when I turned around, 
Shiori-san was collapsed on the floor, convulsing, 
and trying to pull herself upright.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_21:
The middle-aged man had reached out to the  
desktop computer and unlocked the lab table.
[wait][clear][end]

[tab]G...[tab]RU...
[tab]Ia...[tab]Ia...[tab]Itha...[tab]qua...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_23:
When Shiori-san murmured those 
otherworldly words and rose to her knees, 
the room temperature dropped in an instant. 
[wait][clear]With a sound like a whistle, a scalpel-sharp, 
freezing wind began to whirl around us.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_24:
[color(yellow)]Middle-aged Man in a White Coat[color(white)]
[tab]S-she can never return to the way she was!
[tab]She’s switched perfectly with an archetype 
[tab]from the Collective Unconsciousness, 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Middle-aged Man in a White Coat[color(white)]
[tab]and the only one who knows how 
[tab]to restore her lost ego is Kandori...!
[wait][clear][end]

msg_25:
The middle-aged man kept frothing at the mouth 
as the blood flowing from his leg froze over. 
Even that spray blew into the violently 
spiraling wind like glittering diamond dust.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_26:
[color(yellow)]Middle-aged Man in a White Coat[color(white)]
[tab]Heh heh heh...! The sinful Persona Joker 
[tab]has called the "Wind-Walker" from the
[tab]unfathomable Unconsciousness!
[wait][clear][end]

msg_27:
[color(yellow)]Middle-aged Man in a White Coat[color(white)]
[tab]She has become one of the Great Old Ones, 
[tab]who once ruled the Earth!
[wait][clear][end]

msg_28:
[color(yellow)]Middle-aged Man in a White Coat[color(white)]
[tab]Arise, Ithaqua the Wendigo! 
[tab]Ozuki-kun, why don’t we confirm the 
[tab]experiment’s results with our own eyes?!
[wait][clear][end]

msg_29:
[color(yellow)]Middle-aged Man in a White Coat[color(white)]
[tab]Incarnated demons-a Great Old One 
[tab]and an archetype-using a human body!
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Middle-aged Man in a White Coat[color(white)]
[tab]This is a unique opportunity to learn 
[tab]which can best utilize its abilities!  
[wait][clear][end]

msg_30:
With a feeling of despair, I stared up at 
the completely changed Shiori-san 
from behind as she floated into the air. 
"What do I do...?"
[wait][clear][end]

msg_31:
[color(yellow)]Ozuki[color(white)]
[tab]A-anesthesia... 
[tab]in that tank there...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_32:
The narrow-eyed man, or Ozuki as he was called, 
pointed at the big tank next to us with his eyes, 
as I was pinning him down. 
[wait][clear]Right, this guy said he was in charge of 
administering anesthetic or something like that.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_33:
While I considered how to do this, 
Shiori-san’s head spun a full 360 degrees 
as she turned to face me.
