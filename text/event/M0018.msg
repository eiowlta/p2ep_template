[tab]This may come as a surprise, 
[tab]but I tend to eat in places like this often.
[tab]I don’t have time to enjoy a meal.

msg_6:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]It’s not like you have a grudge against
[tab]Serizawa-kun, right? I hope she doesn’t take
[tab]it personally... She just needs some time.

msg_9:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]

msg_10:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]I don’t think that Anna girl is in the Mafia,

msg_14:
[color(yellow)]Nanjo[color(white)]
[tab]No man has a bigger ego than Kandori.
[tab]At least I can’t think of him as a mere 
[tab]cog in a machine. He is up to something...

msg_15:
[color(yellow)]Elly[color(white)]
[tab]How is Mark doing...? (giggle)

msg_24:
[color(yellow)]Part-timer[color(white)]

msg_25:
[color(yellow)]Part-timer[color(white)]
[tab]It’s useless getting purified at the seminar
[tab]if you’re going to get attacked by the Joker
[tab]afterwards. It may be best to get outta town.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_26:
[color(yellow)]Part-timer[color(white)]
