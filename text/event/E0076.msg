msg_1:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]I’m sorry, Sergeant [suou]...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_2:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]I can’t ask for you to believe me, but...
[tab]I wasn’t informed about the attack.
[end]

msg_3:
[tab]The organization does not trust me...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_4:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]If you want to shoot, go ahead.
[tab]But can you at least listen to my story...[delay(30)]
[end]

msg_5:
[tab]I want to atone for the sin I’ve committed.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_6:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]Here, let me explain...[delay(30)]
[end]

msg_7:
[tab]The New World Order is an organization that
[tab]worships a god-like figure called Gozen.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_8:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]You’ve at least heard of Kiyotada Sumaru...
[end]

msg_9:
[tab]That’s right... A Shogun Warrior who used
[tab]to rule this land during the civil war.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_10:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]20 years ago, when Honmaru Park was built,
[tab]they unearthed Kiyotada’s mummy.
[tab]That’s when everything began...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_11:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]The top leaders of the organization were
[tab]responsible for the park’s construction.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_12:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]Until then, they were just a small local
[tab]company, but now they are big enough
[tab]to move this country...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_13:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]All because of Kiyotada’s strong curses.
[end]

msg_14:
[tab]To me it just looks like a mummy...
[tab]They claim to be able to hear voices...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_15:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]They worship the mummy and plan to destroy
[tab]the entire world outside of Sumaru
[tab]to create a utopia.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_16:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]That’s foolish...
[end]

msg_17:
[tab]What are they trying to accomplish?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_18:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]To them, the entire world is a "sin"...
[end]

msg_19:
[tab]An innocent world is created by one tribe,
[tab]a tribe with one universal utopian ideal...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_20:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]The eradication of Sin by Punishment...
[end]

msg_21:
[tab]The spreading of Jokers and fortunes
[tab]are solely for that purpose.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_22:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]That is such arrogance...!
[end]

msg_23:
[tab]Sure, man commits sin... even grave sins!
[end]

msg_24:
[tab]But shouldn’t there be atonement!?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_25:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]One must atone for one’s own sins.
[end]

msg_26:
[tab]Being the Police, shouldn’t we understand
[tab]that better than anyone!?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_27:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]...The problem is their will and power...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_28:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]You may know that fortune telling stems
[tab]from an ancient curse called "Wang Long"...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_29:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]The dragons of Wang Long are underground
[tab]energy flows called leylines...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_30:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]Since ancient times man has prospered by
[tab]watching, or sometimes, controlling it...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_31:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]They are going to use the dragon for the
[tab]contrary purpose...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_32:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]The dragons hate Kegare. If amassed in
[tab]large quantities and released, the dragons
[tab]will band together to kill it...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_33:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]Natural disasters, causing the poles of
[tab]the world to shift, will knock the earth
[tab]off its axis... Destroying the world...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_34:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]Pole shift...?
[tab]That’s impossible...!!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_35:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]That’s the purpose of the Jokers!? 
[tab]That would destroy the New World Order itself...
[tab]That is nonsense...!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_36:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]They plan to elevate the entire city with
[tab]an ancient spaceship called "Torifune",
[tab]while watching the entire process unfold...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_37:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]The Torifune is already made real by rumor.
[end]

msg_38:
[tab]Now, no person can stop the rumors...!
[end]

msg_39:
[tab]The only way is to defeat Sudou and Gozen...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_40:
[color(yellow)]Captain Shimazu’s voice[color(white)]
[tab]Betrayal would be distressing, Chief.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_41:
[color(yellow)]Captain Shimazu[color(white)]
[tab]Plus this is the second time...
[end]

msg_42:
[tab]First your best friend... and now us?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_43:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]WHAT!?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_44:
[color(yellow)]Captain Shimazu[color(white)]
[tab]Your father was an excellent officer.
[end]

msg_45:
[tab]10 years ago, he was this close to
[tab]closing in on Tatsuya Sudou.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_46:
[color(yellow)]Captain Shimazu[color(white)]
[tab]He never figured a friend would betray him.
[end]

msg_47:
[tab]A best friend teaming up with the criminal’s
[tab]father to fabricate charges... (chuckle)
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_48:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]He’s right...
[tab]I betrayed your father...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_49:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]I knew that this would happen ever since
[tab]I heard his son was in the police academy...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_50:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]I knew all along...
[tab]You became a cop to prove your father’s
[tab]innocence...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_51:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]And to gain back the family bond which
[tab]I had destroyed...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_52:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]But at least believe this...
[tab]Your father was a very proud man...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_53:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]He accepted the false accusations in order
[tab]to protect both me and his family...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_54:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]Captain! I have already revealed the
[tab]organization’s information to a trusted
[tab]source! A place not infected by Sudou!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_55:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]Eventually our existence will be revealed
[tab]to the public... No more games!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_56:
[color(yellow)]Captain Shimazu[color(white)]
[tab]Ha-Ha-Ha!
[tab]You foolish old man...
[end]

msg_57:
[tab]That is our intent.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_58:
[color(yellow)]Captain Shimazu[color(white)]
[tab]Kotodama’s revelation takes precaution.
[tab]A story won’t become a rumor if it is too
[tab]unrealistic. We need realism and publicity...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_59:
[color(yellow)]Captain Shimazu[color(white)]
[tab]For that, we must make the public aware of
[tab]our existence, purpose, and power...
[end]

msg_60:
[tab]You have advertised us very well.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_61:
[color(yellow)]Chief Togashi[color(white)]
[tab]You bastard... You think you’re an enforcer?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_62:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]Chief!!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_63:
[color(yellow)]Captain Shimazu[color(white)]
[tab]Checkmate...(chuckle)
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_64:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]For you...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_65:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]Amano-kun...!?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_66:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]Tell us where Tatsuzou is! 
[tab]Ma-ya’s got a really itchy trigger-finger, 
[tab]so don’t mess with her!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_67:
[color(yellow)]Captain Shimazu[color(white)]
[tab](chuckles)... This is how a game should be...
[end]

msg_68:
[tab]The odds are now even.
[tab]What are you gonna do?
[sync][wait][clear][end]
