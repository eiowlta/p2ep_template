[tab]I was just watching a TV show she was in.
[tab]She said she will reveal who the Joker is...

msg_3:
[color(yellow)]TV Announcer[color(white)]
[tab]...So then...
[tab]Who exactly is the Joker?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_4:
[color(yellow)]Wang Long Chizuru[color(white)]
[tab]In Wang Long, the Joker is "Joka", 
[tab]which denotes a human possesed by Kegare, 
[tab]a negative energy such as sin or jealousy.

msg_5:
[color(yellow)]Wang Long Chizuru[color(white)]
[tab]Joka is a dragon, filled with Kegare.
[tab]The Guardian Dragons will absorb bad
[tab]luck during this cycle...

[color(yellow)]Wang Long Chizuru[color(white)]
[tab]It is a much more powerful negative trend
[tab]than that of "Tenchusatsu" or "Ankensatsu".

msg_7:
[color(yellow)]Wang Long Chizuru[color(white)]
[tab]Kegare calls forth further Kegare, and Joka 
[tab]causes sin to increase... The more people sin, 
[tab]the greater Kegare’s power becomes.

msg_8:
[color(yellow)]Wang Long Chizuru[color(white)]
[tab]It is cause and effect... You must not let 
[tab]jealousy and petty grudges consume you!
[tab]You must not perform the JOKER curse!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_9:
[color(yellow)]Wang Long Chizuru[color(white)]
[tab]If you do, you will be possessed by Joka.  
[tab]Thus, those who perform the curse will 
[tab]end up becoming a JOKER themselves.

[tab]Wow...!
[tab]So then, the Joker isn’t just
[tab]one particular person...!?
