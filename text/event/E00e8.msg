msg_3:
When I reached the club, Yoshizaka spotted me 
and came running up with a slight limp, the reminder 
of a hit-and-run.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_4:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Why are you still here, Yoshizaka?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_5:
[color(yellow)]Anna[color(white)]
[tab]Sorry, but...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_6:
When Yoshizaka finished explaining what was going on, 
the club employee called out to me, looking nervous. 
He was acquainted with the other me.  
Nakamura, if I remembered right.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_7:
[color(yellow)]Nakamura[color(white)]
[tab]Yo, [tatsuya], I heard from Anna-chan, 
[tab]but Detective [suou]’s your big bro, right? 
[tab]I ain’t callin’ the pigs from the club.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_8:
[color(yellow)]Nakamura[color(white)]
[tab]D’you know that lady cop too? 
[tab]Dammit, this ain’t funny!
[tab]Normally, the new owner’s got The Man’s number...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_9:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Nakamura-san, lend me the key to the back. 
[tab]I know you’ve got a spare. 
[tab]I’ll talk to her.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_10:
[color(yellow)]Nakamura[color(white)]
[tab]Talk? Hell no. She said to ring it in 
[tab]if anybody tried goin’ in after her. 
[tab]She’s a cop, dude! A cop!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_11:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]You don’t have to call.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_12:
I spotted and picked up a business card that I guess 
that lady detective had left on the counter. 
Shiori Miyashiro... I went ahead and memorized 
her name and phone number.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_13:
The next instant, the card burned up in my hand 
and turned to ashes.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_14:
[color(yellow)]Nakamura[color(white)]
[tab]W-was that some magic trick?!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_15:
Nakamura yelped in surprise. Even Yoshizaka, 
whose expression hardly ever changed, 
widened her eyes. Still, they wouldn’t have been able 
to see the arm of my Persona, Apollo.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_16:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]The key.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_17:
When I held out my hand, 
Nakamura got the key out from the case 
and handed it over, trembling with fear.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_18:
[color(yellow)]Nakamura[color(white)]
[tab]The only spare I got right now 
[tab]is the key for that door... 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Nakamura[color(white)]
[tab]You know there’s another door deeper in, right? 
[tab]I forgot the key for that one in the staff room.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_19:
While I nodded, I grabbed the wooden sword that
was crammed into the umbrella stand behind 
the counter. Given what kind of club this was, 
the rare brawl would break out between customers.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_20:
The other me knew Nakamura had prepared it 
for self-defense, meaning I knew too.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_21:
[color(yellow)]Nakamura[color(white)]
[tab]H-hey, you couldn’t be Joker...
[tab]You couldn’t be, right?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_22:
When I looked up at him, 
Nakamura shrank away.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_23:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Don’t go spreading weird rumors. 
[tab]If it’s the same as the Other Side, 
[tab]that’ll cause problems.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_24:
[color(yellow)]Nakamura[color(white)]
[tab]"Other Side"? 
[tab]The hell are you talking about...? 
[tab]You’re freakin’ me out, man.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_25:
I paid Nakamura no more mind, but when I tried to 
head for the VIP floor, Yoshizaka blocked my way.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_26:
[color(yellow)]Anna[color(white)]
[tab]...You’ve been acting weird lately. 
[tab]Are you really [tatsuya]?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_27:
Women really are sharp. 
She was half right and half wrong. 
But then, it was natural for her to have suspicions.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_28:
The other me would’ve dealt with them better. 
He’d even joked around with her before, 
tried to get Yoshizaka to laugh with 
some lame impression. Not like me.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_29:
It was extremely unlikely I’d get Yoshizaka to 
move until she got an acceptable answer. 
Nothing for it, I decided to tell her the truth.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_30:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]I’m me. 
[tab]Do I look like anyone else to you?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_31:
On the Other Side, I had a scar on my back, 
carved there by Sudou ten years ago. 
The other me wouldn’t have it... or shouldn’t.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_32:
I was borrowing the body of that me. 
She wouldn’t know about any scar 
on my back as long as I didn’t strip.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_33:
This Side branched off by erasing the fact that me, 
Maya-nee, Eikichi, Lisa, and Jun met ten years ago. 
Me and Maya-nee never got attacked by Sudou, either.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_34:
But lately, ever since I started to take control of it, 
scars have started appearing on this body too. 
It’s an omen that the Other Side is in the 
process of encroaching on This Side.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_35:
Without replying, Yoshizaka bored her eyes into mine. 
She was tall for a woman, but I still had a head 
on her. She couldn’t tell that I was a different 
[tatsuya] on the inside. ...Could she?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_36:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Weren’t you going to do as I said? 
[tab]Go home already, Yoshizaka, 
[tab]before things get any worse.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_37:
Yoshizaka averted her eyes.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_38:
[color(yellow)]Anna[color(white)]
[tab]...Is someone really gonna kill her? 
[tab]I said some awful shit to her.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_39:
I didn’t know what she said to her, 
but Yoshizaka didn’t need to worry about this. 
That other woman should have taken responsibility. 
She was the one who caused this mess.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_40:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Don’t worry, Yoshizaka. 
[tab]I won’t let her get killed.
[tab]That’s why I came here.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_41:
[color(yellow)]Anna[color(white)]
[tab]Hey... 
[tab]What do you intend to do, [tatsuya]...?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_42:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Atone... for my sins. 
[tab]Don’t get involved with me for a while.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_43:
With that said, I slipped past Yoshizaka. 
Anytime I got involved with someone else, 
it brought me pain, without fail. 
[wait][clear]I didn’t want to let anyone else 
feel like this ever again. 
With this, I’d bring all of this to an end.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_44:
[color(green)]You cannot go out.[color(white)]
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_45:
[color(yellow)]Anna[color(white)]
[tab][tatsuya]...

msg_46:
[color(yellow)]Young Man[color(white)]
[tab]The lady who entered the back earlier... 
[tab]She was such a babe, 
[tab]the kind that’s way too classy for a place like this. 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Young Man[color(white)]
[tab]Why DID she come here? 
[wait][clear][end]

msg_47:
[color(yellow)]Young Man[color(white)]
[tab]...! You think maybe she divorced 
[tab]her middle-aged husband, 
[tab]and came here to drink away her sorrow...? 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Young Man[color(white)]
[tab]Meaning if I hit on her now, 
[tab]chances are high I’d strike out?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_48:
[color(yellow)]Young Girl[color(white)]
[tab]Joker...? 
[tab]Who cares what he does, as long as I’m having fun?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_49:
[color(yellow)]Young Woman[color(white)]
[tab]That awesome lady from earlier entered the back. 
[tab]I wonder what kind of person she is? 
[tab]...Think she rolls with a bad crowd?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_50:
[color(yellow)]Young Woman[color(white)]
[tab]She might’ve been beautiful, 
[tab]but she had an air around her like she was 
[tab]definitely twisted on the inside! No, for real. 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Young Woman[color(white)]
[tab]And anyway, don’t talk 
[tab]about other women right in front of me!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_51:
[color(yellow)]Young Girl[color(white)]
[tab]The DJ had his fortune come true, but
[tab]I’m not getting any luck in Wang Long these
[tab]days. How come it’s just me!?

[tab]Pump it up, pump it up y’all! ♪ 
[tab]Ya gotta hear my fresh beats! ♪

[tab]Fortune telling’s da bomb! I don’t work! ♪
[tab]You need fortunes in your life. ♪
[tab]So do I, so do you. Hell yeah----!! ♪

msg_54:
[color(yellow)]Young Man[color(white)]
[tab]Wang Long Chizuru, the fortuneteller, is hot as hell! 
[tab]Just once, I’d love it if she’d give me a reading
[tab]in person, but you figure that’d be pricey, huh?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_55:
[color(yellow)]Nakamura[color(white)]
[tab]I’m not gonna say anything else, 
[tab]but... don’t bust up the club. Please.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_56:

[tab]Oh, and that wooden sword’s mine, 
[tab]so take care of it!
