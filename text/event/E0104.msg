msg_1:
When I tackled Shiori-san to the ground, I sliced
open the thick anesthesia pipe creeping through 
the floor with my sword. Liquid gas blew out 
from the pipe and splashed all over Shiori-san.

msg_2:
[color(yellow)]Demonized Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]Fshooooaaaaa!
[wait][clear][end]

msg_3:
Baring her fangs, Shiori-san tried to stand. 
With deadly precision, she slammed into the pipe 
with all her strength.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_4:
[color(yellow)]Demonized Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]Gobooooaaaaa.........
[wait][clear][end]

msg_5:
Gradually, all the while making gurgling
noises as the anesthetic poured into her, 
Shiori-san’s body finally relaxed and went still.
[wait][clear]I didn’t have the slightest clue how much 
she should have ingested. 
Thanks to the volatile gas, my head was spinning.

[color(yellow)]Ozuki[color(white)]
[tab]Th-that’s enough...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_7:
Ozuki, who was trembling in a corner of the room, 
turned the tank’s valve shut. 
[wait][clear]When I glanced at the middle-aged man, 
I saw he was frozen to death with a 
gruesome expression of manic delight.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_8:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]...How long will it hold?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_9:
[color(yellow)]Ozuki[color(white)]
[tab]Probably about two hours or so. 
[tab]And to think, you used enough to knock 
[tab]out an African elephant for three days...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_10:
Ozuki came up next to me and looked down 
at Shiori-san. He also glanced at the 
middle-aged man’s corpse, 
but he averted his eyes in a hurry.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_11:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]...Sorry about earlier.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_12:
If the middle-aged man hadn’t undone 
Shiori-san’s bindings, I might have run away 
with my hatred and killed Ozuki.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_13:
Sure, he participated in the experiment that put 
Shiori-san in this state, but he also gave me a 
hint on how to put her to sleep.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_14:
[color(yellow)]Ozuki[color(white)]
[tab]...No, it’s all right. 
[tab]This woman is an acquaintance of yours, right? 
[tab]I couldn’t blame you if you’d killed me.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_15:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Shinjo... 
[tab]or rather, Kandori. 
[tab]You said he was just ahead, right?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_16:
[color(yellow)]Ozuki[color(white)]
[tab]Yeah. 
[tab]He ordered us to slow you down while 
[tab]he was "welcoming" the other intruders.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_17:
[color(yellow)]Ozuki[color(white)]
[tab]The JSM... I mean, the machine for separating 
[tab]Jokers from Joker-users is down the hallway, 
[tab]straight ahead. Kandori’s there.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_18:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]I’ll be back.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_19:
I left Shiori-san behind and headed
through the door Ozuki pointed out, 
the one that lead further inside.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_20:
Takahisa Kandori. I knew the name, if nothing else.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_21:
I could have sworn that Yukino-san and 
her friends killed him three years ago 
during the Mikage-cho incident. 
And yet, he was here.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_22:
No way it’s a coincidence.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_23:
That JSM thing must be the core of this 
lab’s research; it’s the only way 
they could be manipulating rumors and 
increasing Jokers on such a large scale.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_24:
I guess for New World Order- 
or whatever they’re called- 
the more Jokers the better.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_25:
When I went out through the door, 
the hallway continued with similar 
research labs on either side of me, 
with matching doors. 
[wait][clear]Eventually I reached the end of the hallway, 
and approached a unique-looking steel door.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_26:
[color(yellow)]Eikichi’s Voice[color(white)]
[tab]No, don’t do it for the likes of me...!!
[wait][clear][end]

msg_27:
When I stood in front of the door, 
I heard Eikichi’s indistinct screams. 
It sounded like he got captured and dragged here. 
[wait][clear]He was probably being used as a hostage 
to threaten Maya-nee and the others.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_28:
[color(yellow)]A Refined Man’s Voice[color(white)]
[tab]You’re still a kid... I’m disappointed.
[tab]You can’t handle a company if you
[tab]lose sight of your goals so easily...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_29:
This voice must be that man Kandori’s.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_30:
[color(yellow)]A Refined Man’s Voice[color(white)]
[tab]Allow me to teach you how to cast them aside.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_31:
By the sound of things, Eikichi was in danger. 
Judging by the location of the voices, 
Eikichi was to my right and Kandori to my left.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_32:
First of all, the door right in front of me 
must be between them. 
The door’s hinges weren’t on this side, 
which meant it opened outwards.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_33:
Expecting the door to smack into Kandori, 
I bust it open with all my strength and leapt out 
onto the other side.
[sync][wait][clear][end]
