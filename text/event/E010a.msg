msg_4:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]I see. 
[tab]So that is what happened.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_5:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Is there anything you can do for her?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_6:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]I regret to say that this falls outside of my 
[tab]area of expertise.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_7:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]It is possible for me to return the demon dwelling  
[tab]in her body to the Collective Unconsciousness... 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]But I’m afraid I am unable to call back 
[tab]Mistress Miyashiro’s consciousness.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_8:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]If her soul were still at the stage of 
[tab]Persona possession, like the Joker Users, 
[tab]then I would still be able to do something for her.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]But alas Mistress Miyashiro’s psyche has been 
[tab]completely severed from her body.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_9:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Most likely, when her ego was switched with the demon, 
[tab]it was scattered across a realm in the Collective 
[tab]Unconsciousness known as Kadath Mandala.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_10:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Kadath?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_11:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]It’s the realm where the archetypes of Personas and
[tab]demons slumber, one level shallower than the abyss 
[tab]where my master and the Crawling Chaos reside.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_12:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Your Persona, which acts as your other self, 
[tab]also hails from Kadath, Master [suou].  
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]If I said it was the place where the images of the 
[tab]legends and gods within everyone dwells, 
[tab]would that be easier to understand?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_13:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Once upon a time, the Person Users of yore who 
[tab]mastered the power of dreaming and could  
[tab]personally visit that world called it the Dreamlands.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_14:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]The Dreamlands... 
[tab]If I go there, can I do something for her? 
[tab]Please, tell me, Igor. I want to save her.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_15:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]There are a surprising number of definitions 
[tab]needed for a human to be who she is.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_16:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]She needs to be cognizant of the physical world- 
[tab]to have the perception, knowledge, and memories
[tab]that separate her from others. 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]She needs the drive and emotions,
[tab]the wisdom and perseverance to 
[tab]acknowledge her inner world.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_17:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Even that which one suppresses and keeps hidden
[tab]and would prefer not to admit - those are still vital
[tab]defense mechanisms that protects one’s ego.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_18:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Either you could head to Kadath and gather  
[tab]all these psychic memories that make 
[tab]Mistress Miyashiro who she is, or...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_19:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Got it. 
[tab]How do I get to that Kadath place?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_20:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]If Master Philemon were the Crawling Chaos, 
[tab]your sworn enemy, he would no doubt 
[tab]open the gate to Kadath immediately.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_21:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Right now, my master’s power is waning. With the 
[tab]masses steeped in Shadows it is the Crawling Chaos 
[tab]who has the power to open that door for you.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_22:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]My master cannot grant your wish for an 
[tab]invitation to Kadath.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_23:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]...Earlier, you said there were some people  
[tab]who could go to the world of the Collective
[tab]Unconsciousness by themselves, right? 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]How do I make myself like that?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_24:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]As a Persona User, 
[tab]you are in possession of immense talent.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_25:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Practice enough under the tutelage of a skilled 
[tab]master and you will no doubt become able to visit 
[tab]depths of your psyche within your own dream.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_26:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Mistress Maki Sonomura, for example, 
[tab]is halfway there herself.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_27:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]However, that requires time, during which Mistress
[tab]Miyashiro’s shattered psyche would dissolve  
[tab]and vanish into the Collective Unconsciousness.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_28:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Isn’t there any other way!?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_29:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]There is but one human being who possesses a key 
[tab]that can physically open the "Ultimate Gate", 
[tab]which divides the waking and the dreaming world.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_30:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Allow me to introduce you to the 
[tab]legendary Persona User, Swami Chandraputra.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_31:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]With the "Silver Key" that the Swami possesses, 
[tab]you could surely open the door to the 
[tab]abyssal Kadath.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_32:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]However, a search through the unconsciousness 
[tab]is a highly dangerous journey. 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Kadath is a world protected by gods and demons- 
[tab]as well as my master and the Crawling Chaos.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_33:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]The mind of one who travels through there is 
[tab]constantly exposed to danger.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_34:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]If you let your guard down, you will be possessed 
[tab]by the demon you tried to supplant and no doubt 
[tab]end up the same as Mistress Miyashiro.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_35:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Doesn’t matter.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_36:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Understood. However, the Swami
[tab]is a busy traveler of time-space. 
[tab]It will take some time until I can contact him.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_37:
[color(yellow)]Igor[color(white)]
[tab]Please come again later. 
[tab]You may leave Mistress Miyashiro’s body 
[tab]in my care, I shall take responsibility for it.
[sync][wait][clear][end]
