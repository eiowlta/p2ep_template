The hallway connected to the secret dance 
floor changed into a red Chinese-style design. 
Word on the street was that nobody got in
without the say-so of a regular.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_1:
It looked like the rumors that the Taiwanese 
mafia bought out this club were somehow true.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_2:
Before, when I came to do guidance for the 
students of Kasugayama High, Club Zodiac 
was a cheap place arranged with constellations, 
as the name implies.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_3:
While walking through a vulgar red corridor, 
the sort only the nouveau riche could like, 
I pulled out my cell and called a familiar number. 
[wait][clear]After the fifth ring, someone picked up the line. 
Just like before, the rumor was true.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_4:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]You remember how I asked you to kill 
[tab]Shiori Miyashiro? She’s on the VIP floor 
[tab]at Club Zodiac in Yumezaki Ward.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_5:
That’s all I said before I hung up the phone. 
There was no going back anymore. By the end
of the night, I’d know if the rumors were true or not. 
If I failed, I’d just add another corpse to the pile.

msg_8:
At that moment, I remembered everything.
I remembered that I was from the Other Side
and everything that had happened there.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_9:
Maya-nee, Mayuzumi-san, Eikichi, Lisa, and Jun... 
We swore we’d never forget each other, 
and then we were torn apart.
My friends watched Maya-nee... and me.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_10:
Maya-nee... 
The other Maya-nee was smiling right before my eyes.
[wait][clear]"Are you okay? You’re not hurt? 
Sorry about that! I’m such a klutz. 
Wait... Have we met somewhere before?"
[wait][clear][end]

msg_11:
We did, we did, yes, we did! There’s no way 
I could’ve forgotten, even if you told me to... 
Absolutely. Back when we were kids, 
I was always chasing after you.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_12:
That’s right. Please never stop smiling like that. 
Jun and I promised we’d protect your smile.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_13:
But I screwed up. 
The first time was ten years ago, 
the second was in "his" world, 
and the third time...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_14:
Damn it... damn it...
I got the hell out of there.
I had no idea what I should do.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_15:
That’s why I shut myself away within the body 
of the other me and decided to sleep. 
[wait][clear]If I saw nothing, heard nothing, and felt nothing, 
then maybe, just maybe the peaceful days
everyone had gained would continue uninterrupted. 
But there was no way "he" would let that slide.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_16:
[color(yellow)]Someone’s Voice[color(white)]
[tab]You may flee your sins and hide yourself if you like. 
[tab]But you do know what will become of this world, 
[tab]don’t you?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_17:
[color(yellow)]Someone’s Voice[color(white)]
[tab]You marionette strung on the threads of fate, 
[tab]no one can escape the jaws of despair. 
[tab]I’m waiting. I’m waiting...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_18:
In my dream, "he" left a brand on my right hand,
the mark of a sinner possessed by darkness.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_19:
It dawned on me what was about to happen. 
People can neither run nor hide from themselves.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_20:
There was one thing I had to do.
If you want my life, I’ll give it to you. 
If you tell me to fall into darkness, I’ll do it.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_21:
But I won’t let anyone have their way with Maya-nee... 
or this world where my friends live.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_22:
I’m the only one "he" can do as he pleases with,
but I won’t go down easy. In exchange for everything 
I am, I’ll burn that scornful faceless mask and 
everything else of "his" to ashes.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_23:
It’s the one and only thing I can do to atone.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_24:
Suddenly, the cell phone rang. It wasn’t my brother,
his calls were already blocked without me having
to do anything. Looks like this me got along 
with his brother about as well as I did with mine.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_25:
The caller ID said it was from Anna Yoshizaka. 
I knew the me on This Side hung out with Yoshizaka, 
but I’m not really him. I can’t respond to her like he would.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_26:
It rang ten, twenty, thirty times before I gave up 
and took the call. If nothing else, as long as I was 
temporarily borrowing this body, I figured it’d be 
better to tell Yoshizaka I can’t stay in touch. 
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_27:
[color(yellow)]Anna’s Voice[color(white)]
[tab][tatsuya]...?
[tab]You’re not hurt, are you?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_28:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]No.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_29:
[color(yellow)]Anna’s Voice[color(white)]
[tab]Whew... 
[tab]I thought something happened.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_30:
I knew that Yoshizaka had been waiting all night for 
the me on This Side to show up at Club Zodiac.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_31:
But she didn’t blame me for ditching her or 
ignoring the phone. She just expressed her relief.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_32:
The only person she’d talk like this to is the other me.
On the Other Side, I had also had close relationships,
just like he and Yoshizaka have here.
My chest hurt.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_33:
[color(yellow)]Anna’s Voice[color(white)]
[tab][tatsuya], you said your brother was a cop, right...? 
[tab]Earlier, this weird cop chick came and holed 
[tab]herself up in the VIP floor.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_34:
[color(yellow)]Anna’s Voice[color(white)]
[tab]Seems like she called Joker and told him to kill her. 
[tab]She asked Nakamura-san to give your brother 
[tab]a ring in the morning if she didn’t come out.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_35:
[color(yellow)]Anna’s Voice[color(white)]
[tab]You don’t wanna see your brother, right? 
[tab]I’m gonna go check up on her in a bit, 
[tab]but it’d be better if you didn’t come tonight.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_36:
[color(yellow)]Anna’s Voice[color(white)]
[tab]That’s all.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_37:
The other me had probably never broken a promise. 
Yoshizaka still believed I would come... 
so she went out of her way to call so I wouldn’t 
run afoul of my brother on This Side.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_38:
But the bigger shock was hearing her say Joker’s name. 
On the Other Side, Maya-nee and the rest of us had 
fought against Yoshizaka, who’d become 
one of Joker’s minions.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_39:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Don’t, Yoshizaka. Don’t you dare go in. 
[tab]I’ll go. Get out of there right now. 
[tab]Don’t get anywhere near Joker.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_40:
[color(yellow)]Anna’s Voice[color(white)]
[tab]"Yoshizaka"...? 
[tab]OK. 
[tab]If that’s what you say, I’ll do it, [tatsuya].
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_41:
The me on This Side called Yoshizaka by her first name.
I didn’t have time to correct myself, though. Joker might 
have already been close by. I was concerned about 
the woman dropping my brother’s name, too.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_42:
On the Other Side, my best friend Jun Kurosu 
put on the Joker mask after "he" screwed 
with his memories. 
[wait][clear]But Jun kept his final promise. He should have 
lost his memories of the Other Side and now be living 
peacefully on This Side as Jun Kashihara.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_43:
Someone who wasn’t Jun had become This Side’s 
Joker and is committing serial murder as "his" pawn.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_44:
"Marking the end and a new beginning..."
I vividly recalled the last line of the Oracle of Maia, 
which had served as the trigger to the destruction 
of the Other Side.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_45:
The same thing that happened on the Other Side 
was happening here. The distortion that "he" had set 
over ten years ago had extended over two worlds.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_46:
"He" had known from the start what choice we’d 
make after losing Maya-nee, and how things would 
turn out afterwards.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_47:
Gritting my teeth, I grabbed an extra helmet for 
Yoshizaka just in case and sped off into the 
city night on my motorcycle.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_48:
Fine, then. 
I’ll go ahead and tear the slimy distortion 
"he" wove into causality to pieces. 
And then finally, I’ll rip "his" throat out...
[sync][wait][clear][end]
