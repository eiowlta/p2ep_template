[tab]Well isn’t this a run-down shrine. Will the

[tab]Joker Curse...

[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]I was conscious when I was becoming a Joker. 
[tab]It’s not like someone else was controlling me. 
[tab]I was just upset...

msg_4:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]So... in other words... that is the true me.
[tab]I can’t make any excuses.
[tab]Really... I’m so pathetic...

msg_5:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]...Still, that Nanjo-kun’s really something else.
[tab]He’s rich and quite a catch!!

[tab]The serial killings 10 years ago...
[tab]There is no doubt Tatsuzou’s son was a suspect.

[wait][clear][end]

msg_11:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]It was rumored that the murderer 10 years
[tab]ago was the Joker...
[tab]And that Joker was Tatsuya Sudou.

msg_12:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]In other words, the true killer was

msg_13:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]That boy... He’s the one we met at the

msg_14:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]If Serizawa-kun has already become a Joker,
[tab]she will certainly attack that man...
[tab]So we’re nothing but his bodyguards.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_15:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]Thanks to Serizawa-kun, we now know how to
[tab]cure people who’ve become Jokers... But we
[tab]can’t just take everyone to the Velvet Room...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_16:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]But, considering the information we have
[tab]so far... the New World Order, no Tatsuzou,
[tab]has been planning this all along...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_17:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]

msg_20:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]I want to ask you just in case... If Serizawa
[tab]completely becomes a Joker and we can’t
[tab]handle her... What do we do? Kill her?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_22:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]...Heh, that’s so you. You’re a wussie.
[tab]Just like [suou]. Let me just warn you
[tab]that I’m different from you guys.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_23:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]So you have the resolution? You seem to be
[tab]the type to commit crimes unknowingly. How
[tab]many do you think were hurt because of you?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_24:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]But that doesn’t concern you.
[tab]Because you haven’t done anything.
[tab]So it’s not your problem... right?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_25:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Is Serizawa still bothered? How stupid.
[tab]There aren’t any perfect people in this
[tab]world. Everyone who lives has "Kegare".
[wait][clear][end]

msg_26:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]I’m not trying to console. Anyone who
[tab]hopes for Kegare-free people is a fool.
[tab]So are those who try to become that.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_27:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Humans are a combination of both,

msg_28:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]The more perfect humans are,

[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]If the other person is a Persona user, you
[tab]can tell things about them by the Persona’s
[tab]resonance. But don’t rely on that alone.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_30:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]An expert user can even control the
[tab]resonance. Like him, you don’t know
[tab]what he’s really thinking deep inside.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_31:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Whether you trust me or not
[tab]is up to you.

[tab]They know where we are.
[tab]Even right now they may be watching us.

msg_33:
