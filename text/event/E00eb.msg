This too was unquestionably a secret room, 
but Shiori Miyashiro was nowhere inside. 
According to Yoshizaka, it seemed she requested 
her own death so she could arrest Joker.

msg_1:
Normally, a single detective wouldn’t go that far. 
It also concerned me that she forbade contact with 
any police officer besides my brother.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_2:
There must have been something else going on... 
Could it have been that there’s some connection 
between the police and Joker?

msg_3:
I spotted the key on top of the table, but when I tried 
to approach, the corners of the room twisted mushily 
with a nauseating stench, and from the twisted space, 
several filthy tentacles stretched out.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_4:
I jumped back and just barely evaded them as the
tentacles flung a thick mucus across the entire room. 
Smoke rose violently from the walls. 
This thing’s limbs were melting them.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_5:
Something was trying to rip through dimensions 
using the tentacles stretched to the walls as a 
foothold and force its way into This Side. 
[wait][clear]The walls crawled and so did my flesh. 
I had never seen this thing until now either.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_6:
It seemed the demons on This Side were more 
grotesque and in worse taste than the ones 
I’d seen on the Other Side.

[color(yellow)]Filthy Monster[color(white)]
[tab]Ia![tab]SHUB-NIGGURATH!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_8:
Its body was at once like a festering cloud, 
an octopus, and a twisted tree, and its many 
mucus-discharging mouths set my teeth on edge. 
[wait][clear]Its black feet were split like goat hooves. 
If a normal person had seen this monster, 
they’d probably have gone insane.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_9:
When you awaken to your Persona ability ー to the 
other you who possesses power like gods 
and demons ー you become able to summon a Persona. 
[wait][clear]If you call forth a god who holds sway over fire, 
like my Apollo, you can even manipulate flames at will.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_10:
In the depths of human hearts, shared with all people, 
there is a domain where mythological archetypes dwell, 
and they grant an influence over an
individual’s personality development. 
[wait][clear]Maya-nee said that anecdotes of 
mythological divinities the world over 
probably exist because of that.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_11:
Gods and demons exist not in Heaven and Hell 
but in the hearts of humanity. 
Personas even have an influence on physical  
and mental abilities. 
[wait][clear]My ability to wield a sword like a master and my 
resistance to terror are both thanks to my Persona.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_12:
Gods and demons are not the only 
archetypes sleeping in the human heart.  
[wait][clear]If the collective unconsciousness is where all 
human psyches are born and return to, 
that means I too exist somewhere in the world 
of the subconscious as a master of arms.

[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]But neither you nor I belong on This Side. 
[tab]Go home.  
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_14:
If I didn’t settle things fast, I’d suffocate on this thing’s
stench and the reek of the burning walls. I might have 
been a Persona user, but if I couldn’t breathe, I’d die.
