[tab]Come on in, [tatsuya]-kun. 
[tab]The room over there’s open, so feel free to use it.

[color(yellow)]Pretty lady[color(white)]
[tab]I lived in bachelor housing until last year. 
[tab]I didn’t have any privacy at all, though, 
[tab]so I splurged and rented this place.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_6:
[color(yellow)]Pretty lady[color(white)]
[tab]It’s kind of big for someone living alone,  
[tab]so you came at just the right time. 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Pretty lady[color(white)]
[tab]I mean, c’mon, this is the only place with
[tab]an open room close to my workplace.

[tab]Uhh, we’ll carry the living room sofa to your
[tab]room later, or would you prefer a bed? 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Pretty lady[color(white)]
[tab]Oh, and if you want to watch TV, 
[tab]you can use this room anytime.

When I invited him into my home, clothes and 
what few cosmetics I owned were scattered 
all over.[wait][clear]I tried to keep chatting in as bright a tone 
as possible while I tidied up, but I might have 
sounded a little shrill and nervous.[wait][clear][end]

msg_10:
I don’t know if he was being considerate or was
embarrassed by the state of my apartment. 
He loitered by the window, stoic and silent, 
without looking at the room.[wait][clear][end]

msg_11:
Instead, the long shadow that bore down 
across my floor told the tale of his mental state. 
Of lost bearings, of rejection, and of loneliness...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_12:
He meant to vanish somewhere, 
like shadows slipping into darkness with the sunset, 
doing something all on his own, now and forever.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_13:
But I wouldn’t allow it.
I’ve had circumstances that have been 
on hold for ten years. 
[wait][clear][end]

msg_14:
That’s right, this wasn’t just his story.
It was both of ours.
