[tab][tab]Kounan Lunar Palace[tab]Shiori Miyashiro’s Home
[end]

msg_1:
[clear][end]

msg_2:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]I’m home...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_3:
I knew there wouldn’t be a response. 
At this hour, Shiori-san should still be at work.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_4:
It still felt like I’m barging in here, 
but if I treated it as anything but home, she’d get mad.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_5:
I hopped into the bathroom and took a shower 
with my motorcycle leathers still on. 
It was already soaked with loads of saltwater; 
it’s quicker to wash off the salt this way.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_6:
Tatsuya Sudou is dead, 
but I don’t think this is the end. 
Maya-nee also hadn’t given up. 
[wait][clear]It seemed like all of them ー my brother, Ulala-san, 
and that other guy ー were chasing me 
and Sudou down.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_7:
When I saved Yoshizaka at the Sevens clocktower, 
I gave Maya-nee an emblem and advised her 
to spread a rumor so I figured it’d be safe for me to 
leave her alone for now... I was naive.[wait][clear][end]

msg_8:
The more I pulled away, the more she’d approach me 
with that steady smile until before I knew it, 
I couldn’t get her out of my head.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_9:
Even way back, she would have gotten to me 
like that, but giving her that advice was only 
fuel for her engine.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_10:
Still, I was right to keep an eye 
out for Jun in the meantime. 
[wait][clear]I knew Sudou, who had already tried to abduct 
Yoshizaka, would absolutely try to force Jun 
into the masked role of Joker, and I had been right.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_11:
Honestly, I wanted to settle up with Sudou 
before he captured Jun, 
but I got thrown off when Maya-nee appeared.  
[wait][clear]I’d decided I’d never have anything directly to do 
with him again, but Jun got involved and at that time, 
he ended up recognizing my face...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_12:
Really, at this rate 
I’d need at least five of me to protect everyone.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_13:
I’m sure "he" picked his next move ages ago. 
It’s obvious I still haven’t gone even one 
millimeter off the rails "he" laid down.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_14:
Once I stripped and washed the salt off my skin too, 
I got out of the shower and changed into 
the jeans Shiori-san bought me. 
[wait][clear]I’d like to just let my leathers dry in the sun, 
but there wasn’t any point, I flipped the switch 
on the dryer in the washroom.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_15:
I headed to the room I’d been borrowing and 
threw myself down onto the single sofa-bed.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_16:
Aside from the sofa-bed, there were ten cardboard 
boxes of Shiori-san’s in the corner that she hadn’t 
unpacked and a clothing case for me. That was it.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_17:
I was grateful just to have a place I can stay, 
somewhere close to Maya-nee in case 
anything happened. That was more than enough.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_18:
However, I really should’ve left without saying a word 
the night we met at Zodiac and kept Shiori-san from 
getting involved with this any further.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_19:
But Shiori-san told me about her younger brother. 
I couldn’t leave in silence then. 
Her brother was murdered by Sudou in my place.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_20:
Ten years ago, the day Shiori-san’s younger brother 
was killed was the same day Maya-nee and myself 
were locked up in Alaya Shrine on the Other Side.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_21:
The Other Side’s Sudou set the shrine on fire 
while we were locked up inside it. 
[wait][clear]Since I was just a kid, I was finally able to escape by 
just barely squeezing through a gap in the floorboards. 
I went outside in order to save Maya-nee, 
but I was stabbed in the back.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_22:
That’s when I awoke to my Persona 
and burned Sudou’s face. 
Sudou thought that Maya-nee had done that, 
so that’s why he stalked her.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_23:
But when we lost to "him", 
in order to recreate a world where Maya-nee lived, 
we changed history a little bit and some things 
were erased so they never happened.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_24:
On This Side, we all never met 10 years ago. 
So, Sudou also never stabbed me.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_25:
To fill that hole, Shiori-san’s little brother was killed.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_26:
I understood why. It was a present from "him," 
showing me what happens when we change history.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_27:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Damn it! 
[tab]You fucking bastard!!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_28:
I twisted and pulled at my hair. 
I hated "him" so much I could go mad. 
I won’t forgive him.
[wait][clear]I wanted to kill him. 
I wanted to die and disappear. 
I dug my nails into the mark "he" left on my right arm.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_29:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]!?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_30:
The sudden ringing of the telephone brought me 
to my senses. I was so overwhelmed by exhaustion 
that I thought I heard Maya-nee’s voice on the 
answering machine message.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_31:
The incoming call was on the landline in 
Shiori-san’s room. But something was odd. 
The person who called in didn’t say a word 
or hang up; they just stayed on the line, silent.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_32:
I strained my ears on what I could hear in the 
next room through the slightly ajar door. 
It was after maybe a minute that a man’s 
voice suddenly, hesitantly began to whisper.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_33:
[color(yellow)]Someone’s Voice[color(white)]
[tab]I know who you called. 
[tab]If you’re capable of hearing this, 
[tab]contact Sergeant [suou] as soon as you can...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_34:
Contact my brother? 
I didn’t get it. 
I guess the guy who called Shiori-san was in trouble.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_35:
Wait, "who you called"...? I had a bad feeling about this. 
I jumped to my feet, hurried into Shiori-san’s room, 
and turned on the TV.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_36:
On the Other Side, "he" got humanity to self-destruct 
by making rumors come true and spreading 
anxiety through society.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_37:
I got the sense that by going out of his way 
to make me run into Sudou and
spreading the rumors about Joker, 
he was using the same tricks even on This Side. 
[wait][clear]Even the news was just another one of "his" tools.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_38:
I flipped through the channels until a program with that 
shady fortune-teller woman who did the Wang Long 
fortunes that were popular these days caught
my attention.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_39:
[color(yellow)]TV - Wang Long Chizuru[color(white)]
[tab]Kegare calls forth further Kegare, and Joka 
[tab]causes sin to increase... The more people sin, 
[tab]the greater Kegare’s power becomes.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_40:
[color(yellow)]TV - Wang Long Chizuru[color(white)]
[tab]It is cause and effect... You must not let 
[tab]jealousy and petty grudges consume you!
[tab]You must not perform the JOKER curse!
[wait][clear][end]

msg_41:
[color(yellow)]TV - Wang Long Chizuru[color(white)]
[tab]If you do, you will be possessed by Joka.  
[tab]Thus, those who perform the curse will 
[tab]end up becoming a JOKER themselves.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_42:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]What... the...?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_43:
[color(yellow)]TV - Announcer[color(white)]
[tab]Wow...!
[tab]So then, the Joker isn’t just
[tab]one particular person...!?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_44:
My heart pounded in my throat as every hair 
on my body stood on end. 
[wait][clear]My memories of the Other Side and what had happened 
on This Side intersected dizzily in my head, 
and I understood what the answering machine message 
from a moment ago and Sudou’s last words meant.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_45:
The man who phoned in knew both that Shiori-san 
had called Joker and what was said on TV just now.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_46:
So he furtively warned her that there was 
a danger that she herself would become Joker.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_47:
I didn’t know who the hell that was, 
but it was someone who knew what’s going on- 
but he couldn’t do anything about it himself. 
That was why he told her to ask my brother for help.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_48:
Shiori-san said that there were guys in the 
police force who’re trying to mislead the 
investigation on Joker and Sudou. 
[wait][clear]Most likely, he was someone 
in the police who knew that, 
same as Shiori-san.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_49:
"The fear has been spread!" "The Joker won’t die!" 
What Sudou was saying was that this is how 
Joker will circulate and multiply.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_50:
I leapt at the phone in that room and called 
Shiori-san’s cell number, which I had memorized.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_51:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Come on, pick up...!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_52:
Joker was already drawing society’s attention. 
Air a program like this, and it’d become a 
rumor in a flash. It was a matter of time before 
Joker would appear all over town.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_53:
Respectable people would just 
laugh off a program like this. 
But what happens if what the 
rumored fortune-teller says comes true? 
[wait][clear]What was a joke will become the seed 
for "what if?" for a ton of people.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_54:
People will spread it by word of mouth, 
fear and anxiety will in turn spread like an epidemic, 
and at last it will become reality. 
[wait][clear]That’s how the curse that people unknowingly 
set off became common knowledge and 
the Other Side fell to ruin, just as "he" planned.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_55:
The same thing was starting to happen here-
with the person closest to me as the sacrifice.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_56:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Damn it!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_57:
No good, she wasn’t picking up.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_58:
It alarmed me that it wasn’t even going to voice mail. 
I headed back to my room, picked up the sword I stole 
from Sudou at Zodiac, and left Shiori-san’s house.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_59:
I needed to find her before she killed someone.
[sync][wait][clear][end]
