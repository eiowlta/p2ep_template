When I went back to the lab room 
where Shiori-san was at, 
Eikichi and Ozuki were already there.

msg_1:
[color(yellow)]Eikichi[color(white)]
[tab]Thanks, [suou].
[tab]Looks like I owe you another one.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_2:
[color(yellow)]Eikichi[color(white)]
[tab]That shades-wearing asshole jumped me
[tab]in the parking lot... 
[tab]I’m such a loser.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_3:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Don’t worry about it. You’re a great guy. 
[tab]More importantly, 
[tab]I need to ask you for a favor, man-to-man...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_4:
That’s right, there was no need for him to worry about 
something like that. I owed him so much myself that a 
lifetime wouldn’t be enough to pay it back.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_5:
[color(yellow)]Eikichi[color(white)]
[tab]What is it? 
[tab]Tell me anything, man.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_6:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Don’t say anything to Ma- I mean, 
[tab]Amano-san and the others about
[tab]how we met here or what we talked about. 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]You and I met for the first time back there. 
[tab]Got it?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_7:
[color(yellow)]Eikichi[color(white)]
[tab]...Looks like you got your reasons. 
[tab]Got it, man. My lips are sealed.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_8:
I could just picture Maya asking Eikichi all about me. 
I wanted to cut off as much information about me 
and the Other Side as I could.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_9:
[color(yellow)]Eikichi[color(white)]
[tab]But you know, [suou]...
[tab]if talking it out would make you feel better, I’ll listen. 
[tab]I dunno if you can count on me, but...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_10:
[color(yellow)]Eikichi[color(white)]
[tab]C’mon down to Sumaru Prison anytime. 
[tab]Oh, but make sure it’s after band practice, got it?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_11:
This guy... he hadn’t changed at all. 
He was a scatterbrained idiot, a narcissist, 
and the most kindhearted and 
reliable guy I’d ever known. 
[wait][clear]From the depths of his heart, 
he was completely single-minded 
and completely good.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_12:
I would absolutely keep my word. 
I remembered the last words he told me 
on the Other Side.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_13:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]...Got it.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_14:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]I still got things to do. 
[tab]I can’t see you off, but make sure 
[tab]you get back to the parking lot soon.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_15:
[color(yellow)]Eikichi[color(white)]
[tab]Yeah, sure thing.
[tab]Thanks again, [suou]!
[tab]Be careful out there.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_16:
Eikichi clapped my shoulder and left. 
I’d probably never see him again. 
So long, Eikichi.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_17:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]You hurry over to the parking lot, too. 
[tab]You can’t stay here anymore anyway, right?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_18:
I had turned around to face Ozuki. 
I didn’t have time to immerse myself in sentimentality.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_19:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Me and those other people set that guy just now 
[tab]and the other inmates free. They might take you to 
[tab]the Nanjo Memorial Hospital or somewhere.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_20:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]If you’re with them, you’ll come in handy. 
[tab]Will you cooperate with them?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_21:
[color(yellow)]Ozuki[color(white)]
[tab]I see... 
[tab]So they’re not taking her with them?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_22:
I crouched down next to the completely 
transformed Shiori-san and stuck my hands 
under her arms to test her weight. 
Looks like I could manage carrying her out.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_23:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]I’ll figure something out for her. 
[tab]Hurry up and go.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_24:
With the state she was in, there was no way I could 
take her to an ordinary hospital... Looks like all I could 
do was find that "suitable place" Kandori talked about 
if I wanted to return her to normal.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_25:
I hadn’t figured the riddle would be this easy to solve, 
but the only one who’d know anything about 
this would be the long-nosed old man from 
the blue room.
[sync][wait][clear][end]
