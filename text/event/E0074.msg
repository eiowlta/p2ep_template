[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]In the end, we couldn’t find anything out...
[end]

msg_3:
[tab]Seemed to be under a strong mind control...
[tab]Probably a waste to question subordinates...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_4:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]But they’re doing the same thing all
[tab]over the place right?
[end]

[tab]What are we going to do...

msg_6:
[color(yellow)]Elly[color(white)]
[tab]There are too many of them...
[end]

msg_7:
[tab]Before they do any more damage, we should
[tab]expose the New World Order publicly.

msg_8:
[color(yellow)]Elly[color(white)]
[tab]Kei?
[tab]I want you to send information about the

[tab]Going one at a time gets us nowhere.

[tab]...I want to ask you one thing.
[tab]A penthouse was attacked... Was it you?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_14:
[color(yellow)]Sneak[color(white)]
[tab]...I guess it would be pretty hard to believe
[tab]me... very well... Next time, I will show
[tab]myself. Do as you wish...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_15:
[color(yellow)]Sneak[color(white)]
[tab]There is one thing I must say...
[tab]Wait until after you’ve heard this.
[tab]I’ll be at the Concert Hall in Aoba Park...

msg_16:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Is it him...?

msg_19:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]Wait a minute! It has to be a trap!!

msg_20:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]You may be right...[delay(30)]
[end]

msg_21:
[tab]But, I have to find out if he’s
[tab]really trustworthy.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_22:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Heh... We’ll see. You probably just want
[tab]to find out about your father...
[end]

msg_23:
[tab]I’m not getting involved...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_24:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]Do whatever you want, Baofu...
[tab]Nobody asked you to come along...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_25:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]Amano-kun... I’ll be going now...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_26:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]Hey, what did you say that for!?
[end]

msg_27:
[tab]He’s one of us... He’s our friend...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_28:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Heheh...
[tab]I never thought of him as a friend...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_29:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Besides, he only irritates me...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_30:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]Hey!
[end]

msg_31:
[tab]I’m getting tired of your shit, Baofu!

msg_32:
[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]Get your ass after him, now!

msg_33:
[tab]Otherwise, you’ll be joining our friend
[tab]on the ground over there!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_34:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Well, if you put it that way...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_35:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Ch... Fine... [delay(30)]
[end]

msg_36:
[tab]I don’t care about him, but separating from
[tab]Amano right now wouldn’t be wise...
