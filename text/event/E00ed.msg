This dream "again"...? I was so sick of it. 
It was all because lately I’d been doing research 
on #501 right after getting off work.
I hadn’t slept well at all.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_1:
When I leaned my back on the wall next to the VIP 
floor entrance, I started lucid dreaming while upright.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_2:
A golden butterfly danced in a round room that was 
encircled by pillars. Its flight pattern was even frailer 
than usual, but I knew what was about to happen.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_3:
I mean, the butterfly was just going to turn into a masked 
person and ask me my name, like always. My kid brother 
had bugged me into playing this weird game, and ever since, 
I’ve had this dream over and over again.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_4:
Sure enough, the butterfly vanished 
and the masked person took its place. 
[wait][clear]There is something unusual, though. 
Their androgynous voice was harder to hear, 
and their body had gone dim and see-through.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_5:
Now that I thought about it, the space between the 
pillars was redder and hazier than usual, too.

[tab]It doesn’t matter how many times you ask, 
[tab]I won’t tell you.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_7:
Besides, nobody ever believed me when I told 
the truth, anyway. I had seen him, 
the man who dismembered my little brother.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_8:
What I wanted to know was the butterfly person’s name. 
You want to know mine? Tell me yours first.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_9:
No, now that I was an adult, it was different. 
What I wanted to know was whether 
the rumor was true or not... 
the rumor that Joker is Tatsuya Sudou.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_10:
The monstrous serial killer from ten years ago, 
who was never caught. 
[wait][clear]Becoming a policewoman let me figure out that 
the culprit was Tatsuya Sudou, son of Tatsuzou Sudou, 
the incumbent Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
I had no proof, though.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_11:
In which case, I’d just have to prove that the 
culprit from back then and Joker were one and 
the same, just as the rumors said, and then figure 
out where he was.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_12:
It had taken me ten years to get to this point.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_13:
My dream and my memories had gotten all mixed up. 
Just then, I heard the door unlock and the knob turn. 
I drew my P230JP from my backslide holster, pulled back 
the hammer and disengaged the manual safety.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_14:
The trigger would be lighter this way than if I’d just 
released the safety and shot using double action. 
[wait][clear]Ever since the investigation bureau for #501 
was formed, the order for all officers to be armed 
had been officially given to the Juvenile Division, 
a cooperating jurisdiction.
