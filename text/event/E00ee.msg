msg_0:
The entrance opened quietly, 
and a tall shadow entered the dim dance floor, 
backdropped by lighting.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_1:
He carried a cylindrical weapon turned over 
in his hand. It looked like a sword, which matched 
the weapon wounds of #501’s victims according 
to the forensic investigations.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_2:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]This is the police. 
[tab]Throw down your weapon!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_3:
My voice sounded hoarse as I yelled that, 
aiming at the shadow’s head from the side. 
Ugh, I could have used a hot green tea.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_4:
[color(yellow)]Shadow[color(white)]
[tab]...Shiori Miyashiro, right?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_5:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]I have my gun aimed at your head. 
[tab]Throw down your weapon!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_6:
The shadow barely moved, as if he were a statue, 
but, and I didn’t know if he was prepared for this, 
he immediately released his lethal weapon. 
[wait][clear]I kicked it away from where it fell on the floor, 
then shouted at him again with my gun still 
trained on him.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_7:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]You’re under arrest for being in violation 
[tab]of the Swords and Firearms Control Law! 
[tab]Hands behind your head and drop to your knees!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_8:
He placed his hands on the back of his head 
and obediently dropped to his knees. 
I couldn’t let my guard down, though. 
[wait][clear]His victims weren’t just cut down, there were 
some where it seemed like they were eaten alive. 
Who knew what kind of deadly weapon 
he had hidden on him?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_9:
If he showed even the slightest sign of resisting, 
I intended to gun him down without hesitation. 
[wait][clear]Japanese police officers can’t do shooting 
practice beyond 36 bullets’ worth a year, 
so it’s difficult for us to hit a moving target.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_10:
Not to mention, there was no way you could stop 
homicidal maniacs and junkies with 
a single .32 caliber bullet. 
[wait][clear]Overseas, there’s a controversy over whether even
a 9mm caliber bullet would have enough force.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_11:
Of course, there’s probably a problem with 
using excessive force.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_12:
The truth is, though, I wanted #501 dead. 
He was clearly the culprit. 
[wait][clear]Even if I secured him, he’d receive a non-indictment 
due to being of unsound mind, get institutionalized and, 
if I was unlucky, be back on the streets before 
a few months had passed.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_13:
He’d leave, free as a bird, 
without anyone asking what his crime was.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_14:
In this country, there’s no judicial institution 
in place to handle mentally impaired people 
who’ve committed atrocious crimes. 
[wait][clear]Involuntary institutionalization ultimately 
only targets the mental disability. 
They can’t handle them as criminals.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_15:
Consequently, once it’s been judged that there’s no 
fear of them harming themselves or others, they must 
be discharged immediately-even if the very doctor 
who examined them felt there was risk of recidivism.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_16:
There have been several movements trying to 
introduce measures preserving law and order 
with stronger binding force. 
[wait][clear]However, they’ve been stymied many times over 
because of strong protest from the opposing faction 
that touts protection of human rights.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_17:
So then what about the human rights of the victims? 
The rights of the victims who one day had 
their uneventful but happy lives ripped from 
them all of a sudden, and of those left behind?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_18:
"The perpetrator wasn’t in a normal state of mind. 
They’re incapable of taking responsibility." 
Are you telling me to fucking accept that?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_19:
My loved one’s life and future were unreasonably 
stolen, and the man responsible gets protected 
in the name of "human rights". 
[wait][clear]This is the status quo for this 
country’s administration of justice.
[wait][clear][end]

[color(yellow)]Shadow[color(white)]
[tab] ...Are you crying?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_21:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]I-It’s natural for someone to tear up 
[tab]when they’re tense!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_22:
He could see the corners of my eyes in this dim light? 
Whatever, it wasn’t his damn business.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_23:
[color(yellow)]Shadow[color(white)]
[tab]...Also, that’s a wooden sword.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_24:
The shadow jutted his chin at the weapon 
on the floor. I glanced at it without turning 
my head and confirmed it was true.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_25:
The hallway light streaming in from the door 
illuminated a wooden sword. I couldn’t charge him 
with a violation of the Swords and Firearms Control Law.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_26:
[color(yellow)]Shadow[color(white)]
[tab]...Can I get up now?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_27:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]N-No. 
[tab]You may still have committed unlawful assembly  
[tab]with deadly weapons. What’s your name?!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_28:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab][tatsuya]... [suou].
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_29:
[tatsuya] [suou]? I turned up the hall lights with the 
remote in my other hand, then looked at the 
shadow’s face. While there was intensity in it, 
this was definitely a young man.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_30:
I guessed he was about 17, 18 years old. He looked like 
Sergeant [suou]. Was he former Detective [suou]’s child? 
What was he doing here? Was he Joker? 
I was confused.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_31:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]Do you have any ID?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_32:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]I think there’s a driver’s license in my wallet. 
[tab]I ride a motorbike to school, 
[tab]and I doubt it’s unregistered.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_33:
He talked about himself like he was someone else... 
What a weird kid.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_34:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]Where’s your wallet?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_35:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]My back pants pocket.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_36:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]Stand up slowly, place your hands on the wall, 
[tab]and spread your legs.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_37:
Once he obeyed my directions, 
I completed a quick pat-down. 
He didn’t possess any other weapons.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_38:
Inside his wallet, there was a normal 
motorbike license ー the so-called mid-license.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_39:
There’s his picture and name... 
This was [tatsuya] [suou], all right.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_40:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]Okay, turn this way. 
[tab]Keep your hands where I can see them.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_41:
He obeyed me without question. 
At least his face and photo 
matched up at a glance. 
[wait][clear]But there was something different about
the boy in the photo, who gave a challenging smirk, 
like he’d fight anyone who looked at him funny.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_42:
It was his eyes. What was with this kid’s eyes? 
It was like they’d suck me in. 
What child looked like that? 
[wait][clear]There was a detached quality to his gaze, 
like he’d resigned himself to or accepted something...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_43:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]How did you know my name? Were you the one 
[tab]who picked up on the other end of the line? 
[tab]Or did you hear it from your father?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_44:
The address on his photo ID definitely matched 
what I had pinned down for former Detective [suou]. 
No doubt about it, this kid was his son and 
Sergeant [suou]’s little brother.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_45:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]My dad...? 
[tab]No, I saw your business card downstairs.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_46:
He was probably surprised that I knew his father, 
given his puzzled expression.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_47:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]I see. Did the people from the club ask you to chase 
[tab]me out? Or did you come to kill me...? 
[tab]You wouldn’t happen to be Joker, would you?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_48:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]No, the club’s got nothing to do with it. 
[tab]I came to warn you because Yoshizaka asked me to. 
[tab]If you stay here, Joker really will kill you.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_49:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]Do you mean the advance notice? 
[tab]If you know about that, then hurry up and go home.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_50:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]You don’t understand at all. 
[tab]Your gun won’t do a thing...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_51:
The next moment, I found myself staring blankly 
at the center of his chest. It took me several seconds 
to comprehend that he had seized my handgun along 
with my right hand and pulled me in close. 
[wait][clear]His movements were so hyper-quick, 
my eyes played tricks on me, 
making it look like time skipped.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_52:
He tightly gripped the small 
automatic handgun in his large, 
decidedly un-boyish left hand.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_53:
The slide was retreating a bit too. 
Now even if I pulled the trigger reflexively, 
it wouldn’t shoot. Where in the world did he learn this?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_54:
I felt the forceful beat of his heart on my cheek
through his bright red bike leathers. 
[wait][clear]When I looked up, I saw the handle of a fruit 
knife or something similar thrust all the way 
to the hilt in the wall next to his face. 
It hadn’t been there a second ago.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_55:
If my face hadn’t been buried in his chest just now, 
that thing might have struck dead on 
the back of my head. 
[wait][clear]When he removed his right hand, 
which held my head, he pulled out the 
knife next to his head while glowering 
at a spot further inside the club.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_56:
The blade’s about ten centimeters long 
but all of it had sunk into the wall. 
[wait][clear]The physical strength of the person 
who threw it was impressive enough, 
but this kid who casually pulled 
it out was amazing too.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_57:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]...How long have you been there?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_58:
[color(yellow)]Mysterious Voice[color(white)]
[tab]From the start, DUMBASS.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_59:
At [tatsuya]-kun’s question, 
the voice of another man behind me responded. 
It sounded like he was a good distance away.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_60:
[color(yellow)]Mysterious Voice[color(white)]
[tab]S’been a long time since I had booze. Here I was 
[tab]just thinkin’ over a drink or five about how to axe 
[tab]that broad, when you get right in the fuckin’ way.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_61:
The voice’s owner? #501. 
It seemed that until this boy came, 
I’d been alone with him in the dark.  
[wait][clear]When I arrived, I’d verified that there 
wasn’t anyone in the dance hall.
When did he get here...? 
A chill ran up my spine.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_62:
When I twisted my body around as if to 
shake off my fear, [tatsuya]-kun removed 
the hand that had been restraining me. 
[wait][clear]Without a moment’s delay, 
I alternated my gun at both him 
and the direction of the voice.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_63:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]Neither of you move! 
[tab]Throw down your weapons!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_64:
[tatsuya]-kun didn’t so much as glance at me. 
I, too, kept my aim and my eyes fixed on the 
man further in.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_65:
Ten years had gone by, 
but he looked exactly the same. 
This was without a doubt the man. 
[wait][clear]The boy who’d stood next to Takuya’s 
cruelly mangled corpse... 
His unforgettable, crazed smile...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_66:
I KNEW he was #501. 
Tatsuya Sudou... 
I finally found you.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_67:
[color(yellow)]Sudou[color(white)]
[tab]Bweehee...! First time no see, ya fuckin’ brat. 
[tab]The voices told me all about you an’ the Other Side.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_68:
Sudou was sprawled out on the sofa deeper 
inside the dance floor, legs shamelessly 
stretched across the cushions. 
[wait][clear]He was gulping down an entire bottle of dry gin 
dangling from one hand. He’d probably pinched it 
from the bar counter next to him.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_69:
He had a five o’clock shadow and unkempt hair grown 
out like a mane, and he was wearing nothing but a coat 
on his shoulders on top of a patient gown from 
some hospital somewhere. What a freakish outfit.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_70:
He was carrying a cylindrical weapon in his left hand. 
It was unsheathed Japanese steel. 
I could arrest him "in flagrante delicto" for this alone.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_71:
[tatsuya]-kun walked right up to that Sudou without 
a trace of fear. At some point, he’d picked up 
the wooden sword I knew I’d kicked away.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_72:
He was next to me this whole time, 
how had he picked it up?! 
Flustered, I hurried after him.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_73:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]So you’re Joker on This Side... Tatsuya Sudou. 
[tab]Seems like something "he’d" do.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_74:
These two clearly knew each other. 
But Sudou said this was the "first time". 
What did they mean by the "Other Side"? 
[wait][clear]Who did they mean by "he"? 
Was it supposed to be Tatsuzou Sudou, 
the subject of all those unsavory rumors?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_75:
[color(yellow)]Sudou[color(white)]
[tab]I’m a stand-in, y’know, a stand-in. 
[tab]Just ’til the real one graces me with his awakening. 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Sudou[color(white)]
[tab]The real Joker ain’t me. 
[tab]You’d know that beeeeest of all though, 
[tab]wouldn’t’cha?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_76:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]...Yeah. 
[tab]Jun isn’t a filthy murderer like you.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_77:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]You’re Tatsuya Sudou.  
[tab]You can’t just take Joker’s place.

msg_78:
[color(yellow)]Sudou[color(white)]
[tab]Bwahaha! 
[tab]Yeah...? Yeah, true. 
[tab]He ain’t got an ugly mug like me.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_79:
[color(yellow)]Sudou[color(white)]
[tab]Thanks for the tip, ya fuckin’ brat. 
[tab]What I need is a mask ー Joker’s mask.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_80:
Sudou uttered a vulgar snicker and gulped down 
the rest of the bottle. The booze that spilled 
out of his mouth tracked down his throat and 
drenched his bloodstained hospital gown. 
[wait][clear]The one gracing him... 
Joker’s stand-in... 
What in the world did they know that I didn’t?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_81:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Sudou, it’s not too late, you can still start over. 
[tab]Don’t listen to his voice any longer...!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_82:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]Start over?! I don’t know what the hell 
[tab]you’re talking about, but even ten years ago 
[tab]this piece of shit killed a whole lot of people! 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]You can’t bring the dead back to life!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_83:
A detective shouldn’t say anything like that, 
but right then all I could do was scream it out. 
It didn’t matter if he did turn over a new leaf, 
it still wouldn’t bring Takuya back.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_84:
[tatsuya]-kun glanced back at me with a
slightly shocked expression.

[tab]and ran off with your tails tucked, he got axed  
[tab]by me in your stead. You get it, right?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_93:
[tatsuya]-kun watched my face with widened eyes 
while listening to his story. 
I couldn’t take my eyes off of him, either. 
Takuya was this boy’s replacement...?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_94:
[color(yellow)]Sudou[color(white)]
[tab]Incomin’ phone call. 
[tab]I got an order to kill Maya Amano.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_95:
The moment Sudou said that, a shadow that looked 
like a crimson figure flared up from [tatsuya]-kun’s 
body and assaults Sudou. A black figure seethed 
out from Sudou’s body too.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_96:
The two men all of a sudden were 
locked in mortal combat. 
Over [tatsuya]-kun and Sudou’s heads, 
the shadows clashed in the same form.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_97:
Scarlet and sable flames intertwined and whirled 
all through the dance floor like two snakes 
trying to swallow each other whole. 
[wait][clear]Several bottles that had been left 
on the counter exploded, 
and alcohol-fume flames ran over the countertop.
