[tab]Argh, dammit! 
[tab]Useless piece of junk!

msg_1:
The driveline shorted out and smoke started 
rising from all over the mech. 
The scrap iron hatch opened and the pilot jumped out. 
[wait][clear]He tried to draw the gun at his hip, 
but the tip of my sword in his face was
enough to get him to behave.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_2:
The young man on the other side of the fence 
had already vanished.

[tab]Wh-what’s your objective? 
[tab]Don’t think you can make it out of here alive-
[wait][clear][end]

msg_5:
I pushed my blade forward the tiniest bit. 
The tip sunk into his forehead, 
and a line of blood traced down his nose.

[tab]...U-understood.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_8:
The man held up both hands. While keeping him   
in my peripheral vision, I maintained my stance    
and smoothly moved around him towards the elevator, 
all the while my blade remained against his forehead. 
[wait][clear][end]

msg_9:
He groped one-handed for the elevator button, 
and after a moment, the door opened.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_10:
My blade still against him, I walked in
without hesitation, while he bent back
and revolved into the cage back-first.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_11:
I kicked him in the chin. Momentarily knocking him 
senseless, I grabbed the nape of his neck, made him 
stand up, shoved his face into the button panel and 
stole the automatic handgun off his hip.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_12:
When I released the safety and pulled back the slide, 
I found that one of the bullets had already been fired. 
I ejected the shell and let it roll towards the floor.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_13:
I was just aping Maya-nee, I should’ve 
been able to handle this weapon alright. 
I pressed the muzzle up to the back of the man’s ear.

[tab]Fourth floor.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_15:
With blood dripping from his forehead and nose, 
the man pushed the buttons 31123213B1 in that order. 
When he pushed the G button slightly downwards, 
the elevator began to move.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_16:
I grabbed the nape of his neck and made the man 
stand in front of the doors. If this was a trap, 
he’d be the one getting shot for it.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_17:
When we passed the third floor, the number 3 on the 
panel’s floor number indicator started flickering. 
Several seconds passed, and the doors opened. 
It looked like we had reached the fourth floor.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_18:
I’d figured security guards would be lying in wait, 
but no one was here. 
I pushed the man forward and left the elevator.
