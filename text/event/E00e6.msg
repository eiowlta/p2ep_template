[color(yellow)]Pretty Lady[color(white)]
[tab]Anna Yoshizaka-san?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_3:
[color(yellow)]Anna[color(white)]
[tab]...Who’re you?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_4:
The fact that she didn’t deny it when I suddenly 
asked her name and instead asked for my identity 
proved that it was her.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_5:
I was prepared for it and opened 
my purse and thrust my ID into her face. 
Her blank expression was unusual for a kid her age.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_6:
I didn’t much like my own surly portrait, 
which was printed above my full name 
and my rank as a policewoman.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_7:
[color(yellow)]Pretty Lady[color(white)]
[tab]I’m Shiori Miyashiro, 
[tab]with the Kounan PD Juvenile Division. 
[tab]A pleasure to meet you.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_8:
[color(yellow)]Anna[color(white)]
[tab]...I only came here to use the bathroom. 
[tab]I’m just about to head home.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_9:
She’d already guessed why a juvie detective, 
and not one of the traffic cops she’s acquainted with, 
showed up at this hour.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_10:
As Anna moved away from the wall she’d been 
leaning against, she told me a bald-faced lie 
and began walking towards the exit.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_11:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]That’s not what I came here for.
[tab]Not today. 
[tab]I’ve got things I want to ask you.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_12:
Anna stopped, glanced over her shoulder, 
and fixed me with an emotionless stare. 
I realized she’d jumped to conclusions on why I’d come.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_13:
Otherwise, it wouldn’t have mattered what I’d said. 
She’d have tried to leave, just as she’d been doing, 
to avoid causing trouble for the club.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_14:
Every community has unwritten rules. She dropped 
out of school and the track-and-field scene, 
and found her place in a world where she didn’t belong.  
She was already a part of this apathetic subculture.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_15:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]You know that Daisuke Kaneda, 
[tab]the man who did the hit-and-run on you, 
[tab]got out on bail, correct?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_16:
[color(yellow)]Anna[color(white)]
[tab]...What about it?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_17:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]He was killed.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_18:
The first hint of emotion appeared on Anna’s face. 
Even that was evanescent, and when her beautiful 
eyebrows, twisting with suspicion, returned to her old 
stony-faced mask, she let out a single brief breath.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_19:
[color(yellow)]Anna[color(white)]
[tab]And so you came to investigate me... 
[tab]When did he die?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_20:
Anna no doubt knew far too well what the cops would 
ask at a time like this due to the incident that ended 
her sports career. She beat me to the punch by asking 
for Kaneda’s estimated time of death.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_21:
She wasn’t just gutsy, but also quick on the uptake.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_22:
Naturally, she would have an alibi. 
It wasn’t like I doubted it, either. 
[wait][clear]But with the state of Sumaru city, 
it was possible to kill a person without ever 
personally laying a hand on them.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_23:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]I’m not interested in your alibi. 
[tab]A proper investigator will no doubt come 
[tab]ask you about that soon enough. 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]What I want to know about is this.
[tab]Have you seen this before?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_24:
I pulled out a message card with white letters 
printed on a black field and handed it to her.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_25:
[color(yellow)]Anna[color(white)]
[tab]"yOu’rE nEXt."
[tab]...The hell is this?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_26:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]The sender is Joker.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_27:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]He’s the bizarre, murderous monster from rumor ー 
[tab]you know, the one where if you call your number 
[tab]from your cell, he’ll kill someone you hate for you. 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]You’ve heard of him, right?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_28:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]Something identical to that had arrived 
[tab]at Kaneda’s home. It seems like Joker’s 
[tab]conscientious enough to send an advance notice.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]I never would have expected it would have 
[tab]matched the rumor so perfectly.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_29:
[color(yellow)]Anna[color(white)]
[tab]...Oh. 
[tab]So you think I asked him to kill the guy. Sorry, but 
[tab]if I’d wanted him dead, I’d have done it myself.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_30:
Anna casually flipped the card over, 
glanced at the address, and was about to 
hand it back when she stopped herself. This was 
the second time today she’d made that face.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_31:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]That’s right. It’s my own address.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_32:
[color(yellow)]Anna[color(white)]
[tab]...You got any hunches? 
[tab]I think it’s a prank.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_33:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]There could be some kid who’s got a 
[tab]grudge against me for the work I do.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_34:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]But no, this is my doing. 
[tab]I called the Joker. 
[tab]And asked him to kill Shiori Miyashiro.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_35:
I didn’t know if she was lost for words, but Anna’s 
expression didn’t return to its blank mask. 
[wait][clear]There were probably a lot of guys who’d love to 
see her make a different face from her usual mask. 
My efforts would’ve been praised by those gyrating 
bodies on the dance floor.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_36:
Although I doubted it was this face 
that the guys wanted to see.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_37:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]Have you ever called your number from your 
[tab]own cell? Normally it acts as though the line’s 
[tab]busy and won’t connect, but this went through.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_38:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]He never said a word, 
[tab]but the person from rumor 
[tab]definitely picked up the line.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_39:
[color(yellow)]Anna[color(white)]
[tab]...Why’d you give him your own name?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_40:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]There’s no way I could test it 
[tab]using someone else’s name. 
[tab]Hey, how was it for you?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_41:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]Does Joker just kill the other person? 
[tab]Or does he demand a reward or 
[tab]compensation or something? 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]Have you ever held a conversation 
[tab]with him or seen him in person?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_42:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]His hair ー you think if he didn’t cut it, 
[tab]it’d look like an unkempt lion’s mane? 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]Wasn’t he in his late twenties... 
[tab]maybe around 27, 28?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_43:
As I prattled on, Anna appeared to shut me out again. 
With a cold look, she stretched her arm out again and 
handed the advance notice back to me.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_44:
[color(yellow)]Anna[color(white)]
[tab]...You wanna know that bad? 
[tab]Why not ask him? 
[tab]If there really is a Joker, he’ll come kill you, right?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_45:
[color(yellow)]Anna[color(white)]
[tab]Sorry, since you went to the trouble of 
[tab]preparing that little prop, but I didn’t 
[tab]ask him to kill anybody.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_46:
Exactly right. 
If the Joker was just as rumored, 
even if I left him alone, he’d come to me. 
I just had to wait.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_47:
That was my intention in the beginning. 
That’s why I gave my name to whoever was 
loitering on the other side of the bug tap.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_48:
Despite that, I paid this girl a visit 
because I wanted to calm my nerves.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_49:
The photo of the victim flashed before my eyes.
I’d seen the picture at the assembly HQ 
investigating the bizarre serial murders. 
Nobody wanted to die like that.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_50:
If she had requested a murder from Joker, 
then I might’ve gotten a clue leading to his identity. 
Then I would have been able to arrest Joker 
before there’d been any more victims.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_51:
But that meant this luckless girl would 
be accused of either being an accessory 
to the prime suspect for the murders, 
or else instigating them. 
[wait][clear]I was in such a hurry to capture the true Joker 
that I’d only thought about my own benefit 
and unconsciously hoped for that.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_52:
So naturally, she’d held me in contempt. 
This wasn’t how a policewoman representing the 
juvenile division, which handled the well-being of 
young people, should’ve conducted herself.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_53:
Still, I was a little relieved. 
Judging by how she’d reacted so far, 
this girl was innocent. My expressly 
accusatory interrogation had pissed her off.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_54:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]You’re absolutely right... 
[tab]Sorry for giving you the third degree. 
[tab]I really ought to confirm it myself after all.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_55:
I looked into her without permission from 
the investigation HQ, so I had to make up for 
offending her when she was also a victim of a crime. 
[wait][clear]I might’ve been working on my own, 
but if I broke faith with the system, 
I’d end up just another dirty cop. 
That wasn’t an option for me.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_56:
Besides which, the name of the game was 
to unmask, stop, and arrest Joker. 
I steeled myself, approached the employee at 
the entrance, showed him my badge, and spoke.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_57:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]This club has a VIP floor further in, right? 
[tab]Are there any entrances besides 
[tab]that door over there?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_58:
The man tried to avoid meeting my eyes. 
He knew I was going to be trouble.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_59:
[color(yellow)]Employee[color(white)]
[tab]Nah, nah... We recently switched
[tab]owners and the back’s mid-renovation. 
[tab]Nobody’s using it right now, so it’s empty.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_60:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]How convenient. 
[tab]I’d like you to rent it to me ’til morning. 
[tab]Could you give me the key?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_61:
[color(yellow)]Employee[color(white)]
[tab]Huh? 
[tab]N-no way, I’m a part-timer! 
[tab]I don’t know nothing ’bout that kinda shit...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_62:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]This club reported that it’s a 
[tab]type-3 business, right? 
[tab]I wonder what time it is now. 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]Just when did the alcohol start flowing freely? 
[tab]I’m sure you know the 
[tab]food-and-entertainment laws.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_63:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]If you don’t, perhaps I could take 
[tab]you on a tour of the police station? 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]I think at worst you’d get a 
[tab]month of casual leave, 
[tab]the new owner won’t get mad, right?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_64:
Casual leave, in other words, 
he’d be arrested as an accomplice, 
and the business would get suspended. 
[wait][clear]By law, businesses where customers 
stand and dance must report applying 
for a license to serve food and drink.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_65:
But once they get it, 
they can’t do business past midnight. 
Stupidly honest clubs that close 
that early aren’t popular. 
[wait][clear]If they want to do business ’til dawn, 
they need to apply as a restaurant 
that serves liquor late at night.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_66:
But if they do "that", they can’t let the 
customers dance anymore.
[wait][clear]So-called small and medium-sized clubs conduct 
legally gray business practice just by looking 
the other way.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_67:
[color(yellow)]Employee[color(white)]
[tab]I-I understand... 
[tab]But what the hell are you going to do? 
[tab]Please don’t get me in trouble.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_68:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]Thanks. 
[tab]I’m just going to dance ’til dawn,
[tab]if I survive, that is.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_69:
He gave me two keys, and I handed the man my 
business card, which had my cell number on it.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_70:
It was the card I’d give to kids I was providing guidance to. 
I’d tell them to call me if they had any problems. 
Naturally, to prevent misuse, it didn’t mention that
I was a policewoman.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_71:
Then I politely asked for his cooperation ー namely, 
to call me if anyone else tried to enter the VIP floor. 
[wait][clear]I added that if morning comes and nobody leaves, 
he should also call Sergeant [suou] of the 
Criminal Investigations Division.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_72:
I emphasized that he not contact any other policeman. 
I was sure Detective [suou] would be shocked if he 
got a call just like I requested.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_73:
After all, we’d never really talked before anyway. 
Even if he only knew me by name, I knew him well.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_74:
[color(yellow)]Anna[color(white)]
[tab]The hell are you trying to pull?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_75:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]All of the victims up ’til now have been 
[tab]targeted in places where they were alone.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_76:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]If I’m going to head into the back, 
[tab]staying by myself is ideal.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]There’s no exit or entrance besides this one,  
[tab]so if anyone but me leaves through here, 
[tab]that means they’re Joker.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_77:
[color(yellow)]Anna[color(white)]
[tab]That card from before... It’s the real deal?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_78:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]Hurry up and go home. 
[tab]Not all adults are as understanding as I am, 
[tab]so keep your carousing to a minimum.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_79:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]No matter what happens, 
[tab]you mustn’t come peek inside.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_80:
[color(yellow)]Anna[color(white)]
[tab]That guy you mentioned earlier, Detective [suou]...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_81:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]He’ll probably come see you before long. 
[tab]He’s heading the investigation on #501... Joker.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_82:
[color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]When he arrives, explain to him 
[tab]what  I asked you tonight, and tell him 
[tab]you don’t know anything beyond that. 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Shiori[color(white)]
[tab]He doesn’t think you requested 
[tab]the hit from #501, either.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_83:
Upon telling Anna that, 
I passed through the door to the VIP floor. 
Just in case, I locked the door from the inside. 
[wait][clear]If I were #501, there’s no way I’d ignore 
a locked-room mystery of this caliber.
[sync][wait][clear][end]
