[color(yellow)]Cat Lieutenant General Zula[color(white)]
[tab]Well done, platoon! 
[tab]To think you dispersed even Cthulhu! 
[tab]In commendation, I salute you!

[color(yellow)]Cat Lieutenant General Zula[color(white)]
[tab]Were you not Persona-users, you would have 
[tab]lost all semblance of sanity merely by making 
[tab]contact and resting your eyes upon his form.

[tab]That THING is in our minds? 
[tab]Isn’t it waaaaay too different from us?

[tab]You could call it something accidentally 
[tab]given form by a creeping sense of dread and 
[tab]madness that slowly eats at the mind...

[tab]These days, guys who’ve gone off the 
[tab]deep end are a dime a dozen.
[wait][clear] [color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Maybe monsters like that are already 
[tab]swaggering through the city-just peel 
[tab]back a layer and you’ll find ’em inside.

msg_7:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]This ain’t a decent country. There’s news 
[tab]reports every day about child murders, 
[tab]and each year 30,000 people kill themselves. 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]It’s a scary world we live in...

[tab]I don’t care if it’s autosuggestion. 
[tab]Isn’t it said that sickness and health 
[tab]start with the mind?

msg_13:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]...Yeah, true.

[tab]There’s no "what" or "should" to it. 
[tab]You just gotta keep a hold of yourself. After that, 
[tab]you just need a breather and a good drink.

[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]It’s also important to have an awareness 
[tab]of political participation. 
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]
[tab]Of course, that means fulfilling our own obligations,  
[tab]too, rather than only expecting it from others. 
[tab]After all, none of us live alone.

[color(yellow)]Ulala[color(white)]
[tab]Or else maybe sympathy... 
[tab]If we make the world a nicer place one by one, 
[tab]everyone can be happy... Or something, right?
