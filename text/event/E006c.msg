[tab]I don’t know the logic behind it, but it’s

[tab]The "separated Joker" goes in a tank. 
[tab]It’s known as "Kegare" ("Kay-GA-ray"). 
[tab]Kegare consists of things like hatred and fears.

msg_21:
[color(yellow)]Elly[color(white)]
[tab]What she meant by a Joker is a person

msg_22:
[color(yellow)]Elly[color(white)]
[tab]Many people believe in her readings. 
[tab]It’s already spreading, and those not using

msg_27:
[color(yellow)]Katsuya[color(white)]

msg_68:

msg_69:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]I thought about it a little bit... 
[tab]As far as we know, what the New World Order

[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_70:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]That’s why they made Jokers by using rumors...
[tab]Kegare is the dark side that humans conceal...
[tab]Things like "sin" and "evil"...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_71:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]The easiest sin to understand is murder...
[tab]That’s why they hunt Jokers, who are like
[tab]this mass of Kegare... I know that much.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_72:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]But then why are they collecting Kegare of normal 
[tab]humans also? What about the "pure" humans? 
[tab]There must be something to it...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_73:
[color(yellow)]Nanjo[color(white)]
[tab]They say they don’t believe in it, but yet, 
[tab]they inadvertently rely on fortunes and curses... 
[tab]That is what mankind does.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_74:
[color(yellow)]Nanjo[color(white)]
[tab]Man is not that strong. I do not deny that,
[tab]but I would think twice before I get too
[tab]involved. That is the state of this city.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_75:
[color(yellow)]Elly[color(white)]
[tab]"Kegare"... I hear it often in religion.
[tab]In other words, concepts such as "evil" or
[tab]"ill fate" cause man to commit "sin".
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_76:
[color(yellow)]Elly[color(white)]
[tab]Committing a sin or the cause of bad luck is
[tab]all because of Kegare... That’s why there
[tab]are still acts of purification.
