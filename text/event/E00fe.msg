msg_0:
The security guards were smoking in front of the fence, 
their backs to me. Not very professional.

msg_1:
[color(yellow)]Young Guard[color(white)]
[tab]Hey, is there really an intruder?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_2:
[color(yellow)]Middle-aged Guard[color(white)]
[tab]Yeah, I hear it’s two young women and three men. 
[tab]Just leave it be.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_3:
They probably meant Maya-nee and the others.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_4:
[color(yellow)]Young Guard[color(white)]
[tab]Again? Why? 
[tab]Won’t there be trouble if what’s 
[tab]going on here got out?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_5:
[color(yellow)]Middle-aged Guard[color(white)]
[tab]The hell would I know? 
[tab]But it’s orders from Shinjo-sama.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_6:
Shinjo... I’d never heard the name before,
but it was clear he or she was more dangerous 
than these guys.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_7:
Intentionally leaving intruders alone meant either 
they were confident they’d catch them in a trap, 
or else they wouldn’t get in their way. 
This kind of situation could get ugly real quick.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_8:
Either way, it looked like I’d better hurry. 
I’d grab the keyring hanging from the older guy’s belt. 
He’d taken out another cigarette and was trying 
to light it.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_9:
[color(yellow)]Middle-aged Guard[color(white)]
[tab]Tch, my lighter’s out of gas. 
[tab]Hey, kid, gimme a light.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_10:
The young guy nodded and started pawing at 
his pockets. What an idiot.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_11:
[color(yellow)]Middle-aged Guard[color(white)]
[tab]Hey, what’s taking so long?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_12:
[color(yellow)]Young Guard[color(white)]
[tab]That’s weird... 
[tab]I coulda sworn I just had a light.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_13:
I stretched out my left hand from behind 
them and held out my Zippo lighter. 
The older guy thanked me, lit up, 
and took in a deep, satisfying drag. 
[wait][clear]I’d bought this thing because my 
hand felt empty without one, 
it’d surprisingly come in handy.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_14:
[color(yellow)]Middle-aged Guard[color(white)]
[tab]Thanks, kid.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_15:
[color(yellow)]Young Guard[color(white)]
[tab]Oh, here it is! 
[tab]Okay, here you...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_16:
Just as the younger one found his lighter, 
he finally noticed me, gaping in shock. 
[wait][clear]Quick as a wink, I smashed my left elbow into the 
older guy’s face and dropped him. Then I sandwiched 
the younger guy against the shutter and smashed 
the hilt of my sword into his solar plexus.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_17:
[color(yellow)]Young Guard[color(white)]
[tab]Gkh... 
[tab]urgh... ugh...!
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_18:
I saw the older man crumple to the ground from the 
corner of my eye. I went easier on the younger one. 
He managed to keep to his feet, doubled over
in pain and gasping for air. 
[wait][clear]I grabbed him by the nape of the neck, 
slammed him into the fence, then unsheathed 
my sword just enough to expose the blade, 
which I pressed against his neck.
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_19:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]I know you’ve got a long-haired female cop 
[tab]named Shiori Miyashiro captured. 
[tab]Where is she?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_20:
[color(yellow)]Young Guard[color(white)]
[tab]F-Fourth floor... 
[tab]In the research... lab...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_21:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]The elevator only has buttons for three floors. 
[tab]How do you go higher?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_22:
[color(yellow)]Young Guard[color(white)]
[tab]The order you push the elevator buttons in... 
[tab]is the security code, I heard... 
[tab]I don’t... know it...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_23:
[color(yellow)][tatsuya][color(white)]
[tab]Who does? 
[tab]That guy?
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_24:
[color(yellow)]Young Guard[color(white)]
[tab]The supervisor in charge of security... 
[tab]He’s in the room on... 
[tab]the other side of this fence...
[sync][wait][clear][end]

msg_25:
Looks like I had to go by elevator to get to 
the other side of the fence.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_26:
When he told me the older guy’s key ring had
the key to the elevator switch board, 
this time I gave him a knee to the solar plexus 
as a present and put him to sleep.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_27:
It was probably pointless to ask these guys about 
Maya-nee and the others. I grabbed the key ring from 
the sprawled-out older guy as my reward for the light, 
and then left the area.
[sync][wait][clear][end]
