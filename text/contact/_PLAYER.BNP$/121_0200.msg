[tab]Damn! They lost... It would have been
[tab]alright if they lost to another team, but I
[tab]can't stand losing to the "Yomiuri Giants"!
[wait][clear][end]

msg_1:
[color(yellow)]Nanjo[color(white)]
[tab]I won't have any slander against the
[tab]"Giants", not even from you, Mr. Baofu!
[wait][clear][end]

msg_2:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]I can't stand those overpaid, underachieving
[tab]bunch of losers! If you want to cheer for a
[tab]REAL team, try the "Hankami Jaguars".
[wait][clear][end]

msg_3:
[color(yellow)]Nanjo[color(white)]
[tab]"Those who train defeat those who do not"!
[tab]Is there any amusement in backing a loser?
[tab]A real man should always try to be #1!
[wait][clear][end]

msg_4:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Bullcrap!
[tab]Hey, Demon!
[tab]Say something to this rich-boy!
[wait][clear][end]

msg_5:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]I'll explain it to you since you don't seem
[tab]to get it. Baseball is a drama! There is no
[tab]suspense when the best team always wins.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_6:
[color(yellow)]Nanjo[color(white)]
[tab]I have no interest in dramas.
[tab]Those who win are of course those who
[tab]can strategically apply their knowledge.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_7:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]You sassy punk...
[tab]Hey demon! Talk some sense into this guy!
[wait][clear][end]

msg_8:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Listen rich-boy! A man must hit bottom
[tab]before he can be on top. "Giants" fans
[tab]are not real men at all!
[wait][clear][end]

msg_9:
[color(yellow)]Nanjo[color(white)]
[tab]Such narrow-mindedness! Winners train not
[tab]to lose, hence they win. Continuous losing
[tab]only demonstrates incompetence.
[wait][clear][end]

msg_10:
[load_sound(sndeff_1e)][sync][color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]That does it!
[tab]Hey demon! Help me [play_sound(sndeff_1e)][sync]beat some sense into
[tab]this damn rich-boy![sync]
[wait][clear][end]

msg_11:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Just listen. If you don't cooperate,
[tab]I'll start scattering these...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_12:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]What do you think of this tape...?
[tab]Good audio quality, huh?
[tab]Puts you in a compromising position, huh?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_13:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Hold on a second...
[tab]Listen to this really carefully...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_14:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]You're a pretty cunning guy...
[tab]Hey, don't get the wrong idea!
[tab]This is business...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_15:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Hold it, don't jump to conclusions...
[tab]Listen to this first...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_16:
[load_sound(sndeff_18)][sync][color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Y'know, [play_sound(sndeff_18)][sync]it's a waste
[tab]to keep this under wraps...[sync]
[tab]Is it okay if I start scattering these?
[wait][clear][end]

msg_17:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]You idiot...
[tab]Dying so quickly like that...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_18:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]A toast to your death doesn't taste good...
[tab]Hurry up and come back to us...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_19:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]It's alright...
[tab]Let's stay like this for a while...
[tab]At least until you make it to Hell...
[wait][clear][end]

msg_20:
[color(yellow)]Baofu[color(white)]
[tab]Heh heh...
[tab]Isn't this a bit of a load for young master Nanjo?
[tab]I can do this by myself!
[wait][clear][end]

msg_21:
[color(yellow)]Nanjo[color(white)]
[tab]If you say so, let me watch how you will
[tab]handle this.
