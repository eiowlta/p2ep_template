[wait][clear][end]

msg_11:

msg_16:
[color(yellow)]Meteor Masa[color(white)]

[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Meteor Masa[color(white)]
[tab]Twice in the Sanitarium, 8 times on the Blimp, 
[tab]and this is hard, 21 times during
[tab]the Affinity Reading.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Meteor Masa[color(white)]
[tab]For your information, he said it several
[tab]times in this Extra Dungeon, but I said in
[tab]the story, so it doesn’t count.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Meteor Masa[color(white)]
[tab]But still, you got mad memory skills to
[tab]know that one! You’re one crazy gamer!

msg_19:
[color(yellow)]Meteor Masa[color(white)]
[tab]Ohhh, incorrect.
[tab]You went too far.
[tab]He didn’t say it that many times.
