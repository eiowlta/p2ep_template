[tab]Excuse me, can you tell me what year this is?
[tab]How many years into the future is this place?
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Male Student[color(white)]
[tab]Ah, please don’t take this wrong.
[tab]I’m sane and I’m not joking around either.
[tab]How should I explain...
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Male Student[color(white)]
[tab]I came to this world when I came out of
[tab]room 3-B to go home. See this metal plate
[tab]and how old it is?
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Male Student[color(white)]
[tab]In the world I know of, this was just installed. 
[tab]That’s how I figured out that this is the future.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Male Student[color(white)]
[tab]Probably something in 3-B is creating a time slip. 
[tab]But I can’t return because of the flames.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Male Student[color(white)]
[tab]Can’t you do something about the flame with
[tab]your powers? If you can’t, then your friend,
[tab]no, even a god or a demon would suffice!
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Male Student[color(white)]
[tab]I don’t have time to be in a place like this... 
[tab]Finals are coming up...
[tab]Ugh... What am I supposed to do...
[wait][clear][end]

[tab]Borrow the power of a demon... I said that out
[tab]of desperation, but that may be a good idea...
[tab]Nah, what am I saying...
[wait][clear][end]
