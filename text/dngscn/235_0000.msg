[tab]You have fought against many foes before
[tab]you came here. I am sure that none of
[tab]them were easy.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Philemon[color(white)]
[tab]A personâ€™s heart tends to remember bitter
[tab]memories more vividly. Those memories will
[tab]hinder your way from here on.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Philemon[color(white)]
[tab]My other half will awaken all the bitterness
[tab]of the battles... the struggles that you have
[tab]experienced.
[wait][clear][color(yellow)]Philemon[color(white)]
[tab]Now, go. Overcome the hardship of having
[tab]limited places of recovery, and sever your
[tab]accursed memories.
[wait][clear][end]
